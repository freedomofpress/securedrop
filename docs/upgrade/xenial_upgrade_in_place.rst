Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) - Upgrading in Place
==============================================

The SecureDrop *Application* and *Monitor* servers may be upgraded-in-place to 
Xenial using the procedure described here. This procedure does not require 
physical access to the servers, but it will result in downtime for your instance
- on the order of 8 hours if no issues are encountered, and longer if anything 
goes wrong.

The process is less complex than the alternative 
:doc:`xenial_backup_install_restore` procedure however, and if you are using 
supported hardware and the downtime described is acceptable, it is the preferred
option for upgrading your instance.

.. caution::
  We have tested the upgrade-in-place procedure on officially supported hardware, 
  but cannot guarantee that the Ubuntu ``do-release-upgrade`` command will 
  complete successfully on other hardware configurations.

  If your instance uses unsupported hardware and you have access to backup 
  hardware, we recommend following the procedure documented in 
  :doc:`xenial_backup_install_restore` instead.


Before you begin
----------------
Before performing the upgrade, please perform all the steps outlined in
:doc:`xenial_prep`.

.. warning::
  In order to successfully upgrade your SecureDrop instance, it is of critical
  importance that your *Admin Workstation* and your servers use SecureDrop
  0.12.0. Older releases of SecureDrop do not not support Ubuntu 16.04.

                                                                                
We expect that the upgrade should take under 8 hours to complete, but recommend 
that you plan for 2 days of downtime for your instance, in case of error. You
should coordinate the timing of the upgrade with the people responsible for 
checking for submissions. If they have ongoing conversations with sources, or 
are expecting submissions, it may be necessary to reschedule the upgrade. You 
should also consider communicating the planned downtime and the reason for it 
on your instance's landing page.


Step 1: Upgrade the *Monitor Server*
------------------------------------

Start up the *Admin Workstation* with persistence unlocked and an adminstration 
password set. When you are connected to the Tor network, open a terminal by 
selecting **Applications > Favorites > Terminal**. Then connect to the *Monitor 
Server* with the command ``ssh mon``.

The operating system upgrade process for the *Monitor Server* will take
approximately 30-60 minutes, depending on your server specifications and
available bandwidth, and should not be interrupted once begun. To begin the
process, run the command below and then supply the answers listed below to the
prompts that follow:

.. code:: sh

  sudo do-release-upgrade

.. note:: The prompt answers below have been tested on the
  :ref:`recommended hardware <Specific Hardware Recommendations>` for
  SecureDrop. If your instance uses non-standard hardware, you may see different
  or additional prompts. In general, when responding to these prompts, you
  should choose to preserve existing configuration files whenever possible.

- Run ``sudo do-release-upgrade`` to start the upgrade process
- Press Enter after the "Some third party entries..." message
- Type 'y' and press Enter to continue after the "Installing the upgrade..."
  message
- Type 'y' and press Enter to continue after the "Fetching and installing..."
  message

.. note:: The ``do-release-upgrade`` script displays some dialogs using
  ``ncurses``, a library for rendering GUI elements in text-only displays. It
  may display incorrectly within your terminal window. To force a redraw, adjust
  the terminal window's size to approximately 150 columns by 40 rows, by
  dragging the corners. If it still does not display correctly, make small
  adjustments to the terminal size to force successive redraws.

- Choose **OK** to close the Postfix information dialog
- Choose **No Configuration** and **OK** on the "General type of mail
  configuration" dialog
- Choose **Yes** on the "Configuring libssl.0.0:amd64" dialog - when you do so,
  the ``sshd`` and ``tor`` daemons will restart, breaking your connection to the
  *Monitor Server*
- Close the terminal window, open a new one, and reconnect with the command
  ``ssh mon``
- Choose **No** to overriding local changes on the "PAM configuration" dialog
- Choose the default action (keep local version) when prompted about
  ``blacklist.conf`` changes
- Choose **Keep the local version currently installed** on the
  "Configuring grub-efi-amd64" dialog
- Choose default (keep current version) when prompted about ``/etc/ssh/moduli``
  changes
- Choose default (keep current version) when prompted about
  ``/etc/ssh/ssh_config`` changes
- Choose default (keep current version) when prompted about ``/etc/pam.d/sshd``
  changes
- Choose **keep local version currently installed** and **OK** on the
  "Configuring unattended-upgrades" dialog
- Type 'y' and press Enter to remove obsolete packages when prompted
- Type 'y' and press Enter to restart the system and complete the update

The *Monitor Server* will now reboot - this may take several minutes. In order
to reconnect via ``ssh mon``, you must stop and restart the
*Admin Workstation's* Internet connection, using the upper-right-hand control in
the Tails menu bar.

To confirm that the upgrade succeeded, connect from a terminal using the command
``ssh mon`` and run the following command to display the installed OS version:

.. code:: sh

  sudo lsb_release -a

The output should include the text "Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS".

Exit the SSH session to the *Monitor Server*. Next, you will upgrade the
*Application Server* using a a similar procedure.

Step 2: Upgrade the *Application Server*
-----------------------------------------

On your *Admin Workstation*, open a terminal by selecting
**Applications > Favorites > Terminal**. Then connect to the
*Application Server* with the command ``ssh app``.

The operating system upgrade process should take a similar amount of time as
the upgrade of the *Monitor Server*, and should not be interrupted once begun.

To begin the process, run the command below and then supply the answers listed
below to the prompts that follow.

.. code:: sh

  sudo do-release-upgrade

.. note:: As with the *Monitor Server*, the exact prompts may vary based on your
  hardware, and you should choose to preserve existing configuration files
  whenever possible.

- Run ``sudo do-release-upgrade`` to start the upgrade process
- Press Enter after the "Some third party entries..." message
- Type 'y' and press Enter to continue after the "Installing the upgrade..."
  message
- Type 'y' and press Enter to continue after the "Fetching and installing..."
  message
- Choose **OK** to close the Postfix information dialog
- Choose **No Configuration** and **OK** on the "General type of mail
  configuration" dialog
- Choose **Yes** on the "Configuring libssl.0.0:amd64" dialog - when you do so,
  the ``sshd`` and ``tor`` daemons will restart, breaking your connection to the
  *Application Server*
- Close the terminal window, open a new one, and reconnect with the command
  ``ssh app``
- Choose **No** to overriding local changes on the "PAM configuration" dialog
- Choose the default action (keep local version) when prompted about
  ``blacklist.conf`` changes
- Choose **Keep the local version currently installed** on the
  "Configuring grub-efi-amd64" dialog
- Choose default (keep current version) when prompted about ``/etc/ssh/moduli``
  changes
- Choose default (keep current version) when prompted about
  ``/etc/ssh/ssh_config`` changes
- Choose default (keep current version) when prompted about ``/etc/pam.d/sshd``
  changes
- Choose **keep local version currently installed** and **OK** on the
  "Configuring unattended-upgrades" dialog
- Type 'y' and press Enter to remove obsolete packages when prompted
- Type 'y' and press Enter to restart the system and complete the update

The *Application Server* will now reboot - this may take several minutes. In
order to reconnect via ``ssh app``, you must stop and restart the
*Admin Workstation's* Internet connection,  using the upper-right-hand control
in the Tails menu bar.

To confirm that the upgrade succeeded, connect from a terminal using the command
``ssh app`` and run the following command to display the installed OS version:

.. code:: sh

  sudo lsb_release -a

The output should include the text "Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS".

Disconnect the SSH session to the Application Server. You are now ready to move
on to the next step: reinstalling SecureDrop on the Xenial servers.

Step 3: Reinstall SecureDrop 
----------------------------

First, you'll need make sure your *Admin Workstation*'s SecureDrop application
code is up-to-date and validated. From a terminal, run the following commands:
                                                                                
.. code:: sh                                                                    
                                                                                
 cd ~/Persistent/securedrop                                                     
 git checkout 0.12.0                                                            
 git tag -v 0.12.0                                                              
                                                                                
You should see ``Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"`` in the 
output of that last command, along with the fingerprint 
``"2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"``
                                                                                
.. caution::                                                                    
                                                                                
 If you do not, signature verification has failed and you should not proceed 
 with the installation. If this happens, please contact us at 
 securedrop@freedom.press.
                                                                                
If the command above returns the expected value, you may proceed with the installation.

In the terminal, run the following command to set up the SecureDrop 
admin environment:

.. code:: sh

  ./securedrop-admin setup

Next, verify that the SecureDrop configuration matches expected values, by 
stepping through the configuration using:

.. code:: sh

  ./securedrop-admin sdconfig

Finally, install the Ubuntu 16.04 version of the server application code and
configuration:

.. code:: sh

  ./securedrop-admin install

You will be prompted for the admin user's passphrase on the servers. Type it in
and press Enter.

Step 4: Validate the Instance
-----------------------------

While we have extensively tested the upgrade on recommended hardware, we
recommend performing the following tests yourself to identify potential issues
specific to your system configuration.

Validate the kernel version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure you are logged out, and then type the commands ``ssh app uname -r`` and
``ssh mon uname -r`` in your terminal window.

The output for both commands should be ``4.4.167-grsec``, which indicates that
the latest available kernel for SecureDrop is installed on your *Application
Server* and your *Monitor Server*.

Validate the application version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To confirm that you are running SecureDrop 0.12.0 for Xenial, on the Tails
desktop, you should find a shortcut called **SecureDrop Source Interface**.
Double-click it to launch the Tor browser.

After the *Source Interface* loads, add the path ``/metadata`` to the URL in
your address bar. If your *Source Interface* can be found at
``examplenot4real.onion``, then the address you should visit is
``examplenot4real.onion/metadata``. That page should show you key/value pairs,
including ``0.12.0`` for ``sd_version`` and ``16.04`` for ``server_os``.

End-to-end test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend an end-to-end test of document submission, reply and decryption.
First, confirm that you can log into the *Journalist Interface*. On the Tails
desktop, you should find a shortcut called **SecureDrop Journalist Interface**.
Double-click it to launch the Tor browser.

Once the page has finished loading, sign in using your SecureDrop login
credentials. Confirm that you can view the list of submissions as expected.

Keep the browser window open, and launch the **SecureDrop Source Interface**
using its shortcut on the Tails desktop. The *Source Interface* should load in
another browser tab.

Once the page has finished loading, click **Submit Documents**. On the subsequent
page, click **Submit Documents** again (you may want to write down your codename
in case you need it for further testing).On the following screen, choose a
simple file to upload, and enter a message to go along with it, then press
**Submit**.

Switch to the tab with the *Journalist Interface*, reload it, and confirm that
you can see your new submission. Write a reply, and switch back to the
*Source Interface*. Reload it, and confirm that you can see the reply.

Now, from the *Journalist Interface*, download the submission you just made.
Copy it to your *Transfer Device* and boot into your *Secure Viewing Station*.
Confirm that you can open the encrypted document.

Just in case you picked the wrong submission, we strongly recommend following
standard precautions, e.g., do not open the document directly from the *Transfer
Device* but copy it onto the *Secure Viewing Station* first.
