Upgrade from 0.8.0 to 0.9.0
===========================

Updating the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------

We recommend that you update all Tails drives to version 3.9, which was released
concurrently with SecureDrop 0.9.0 on September 5, 2018. Follow the
graphical prompts on your workstations to perform this upgrade.

For the *Journalist Workstations* and the *Admin Workstation*, the graphical
SecureDrop updater will also prompt you to update the SecureDrop code on your
workstations. The updater was introduced in SecureDrop 0.7.0. It looks like
this:

.. |SecureDrop updater| image:: ../images/0.6.x_to_0.7/securedrop-updater.png

|SecureDrop updater|

If the updater does not appear, you may not have updated your workstation code
since the release of SecureDrop 0.7.0 in May 2018. You can manually update your
workstation by issuing the following commands on each workstation:

.. code:: sh

   cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
   git fetch --tags
   gpg --recv-key "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
   git tag -v 0.9.0

The output should include the following two lines:

.. code:: sh

   gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
   gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what you see
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the new
release:

.. code:: sh

  git checkout 0.9.0

Please verify that the output of this command does not contain
the text "warning: refname '0.9.0' is ambiguous".

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '0.9.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following command:

.. code:: sh

  ./securedrop-admin setup

Please note that this only updates the SecureDrop code on the workstation.
Tails upgrades still have to be performed separately.

Database Migration May Take Time to Complete
--------------------------------------------
Some of the changes in this release require a database migration that can take
additional time during the upgrade process, especially if you are not using an
SSD on your *Application Server*, or if you store data about a large number of
sources and submissions on the server. This is normal behavior during the
automatic upgrade, and the *Source Interface* and *Journalist Interface* will
become available again once the upgrade has been completed. In case of a service
outage of more than two hours, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

New Dialogs in Tails 3.9
------------------------
When you run the ``securedrop-admin setup`` command, Tails as of version 3.9
will prompt to install packages automatically from persistent storage on each
boot. These apt packages don't need to persist; click on `Install Only Once`
when you see this dialog:

      |Tails Apt Persistence|

.. |Tails Apt Persistence| image:: ../images/tails-install-once-or-every-time.png

Troubleshooting Kernel Issues
-----------------------------

SecureDrop 0.9.0 ships with an update of the Linux kernel running on your
*Application* and *Monitor Servers*, from version 4.4.135 to version 4.4.144.
If you have not previously changed your default kernel, your server will
boot into the new kernel automatically on its next reboot.

We have tested this kernel extensively against :ref:`recommended hardware <Specific Hardware Recommendations>`
and other common configurations. Please consult our :doc:`kernel troubleshooting guide <../kernel_troubleshooting>`
for instructions on how to compare the differences between kernel versions and
how to roll back to an earlier version if necessary.

.. important::

  It is of critical importance for the security and stability of your instance
  that you :ref:`report kernel compatibility issues <Report Compatibility Issues>`
  to us as soon as you become aware of them.

Enabling the New Kernel After a Downgrade
-----------------------------------------

If you have previously downgraded your kernel to the 3.14.x series due to
compatibility issues with the kernel that shipped with SecureDrop 0.7.0 or
later, we urge you to test the latest kernel (version 4.4.144).

You can test the new kernel without downtime by following
:ref:`our instructions for testing and enabling a new kernel after a downgrade
<Test and Enable an Updated Kernel>`. Please note that this is *only* necessary
if you have manually downgraded the kernel; otherwise, the new kernel will be
enabled automatically.

.. important::

  The next regular release of SecureDrop, version 0.10.0, will no longer
  preserve a preference for a downgraded kernel. If you have downgraded your
  kernel, testing the new kernel and :ref:`reporting compatibility issues <Report Compatibility Issues>`
  is of critical importance to minimize the risk of an outage of your SecureDrop
  instance.
