Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) -  back up, install, restore
======================================================

One way to upgrade your instance to Xenial is to take a backup of your existing 
instance, install a new Xenial-based instance on new or existing hardware, and then cut over to and validate the new instance. 

With the use of separate hardware, this method minimizes the downtime required for the upgrade, and allows you to validate the instance before permanently cutting over. However, it does require physical access to the servers to complete the installation. If you do not have physical access to the servers, you should consider using the upgrade-in-place method to upgrade to Xenial, which can be completed from the *Admin Workstation* over Tor. 


Before you begin
----------------

Before you get started, make sure that you have completed the :doc:`preparatory steps for the Xenial upgrade <xenial_prep>`. As you will be installing onto new hardware, you wil lneed physical access to the servers and firewall, and you will need a monitor and keyboard to connect to the servers during the OS installation.

If you are planning to install the Xenial instance on new hardware, make sure that you have all the necessary hardware to hand and configured. This guide assumes that you are either using the existing hardware firewall, or a new firewall preconfigured with the same settings as your existing one. 

Although downtime should be minimal, you should coordinate the timing of the upgrade with the people responsible for checking for submissions. If they have ongoing conversations with sources, or are expecting submissions, it may be necessary to reschedule the upgrade. You should also consider communicating the planned downtime and the reason for it on your instance's landing page.

 

Step 1: back up your instance
-----------------------------

First, you should back up your instance. Start up the *Admin Workstation* with persistence enabled and an administration password set. Then, once you are connected to the Tor network, open a terminal and run the following commands:

.. code:: sh

 cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
 ./securedrop-admin setup
 ./securedrop-admin backup

This will create a backup named ``sd-backup-<date>.tar.gz`` in the ``~/Persistent/securedrop/install_files/ansible-base`` directory. Make a note of the exact name, as you'll need it later.

You should also make a copy of the configuration files that allow the *Admin Workstation* to connect to the hidden services on the *Application Server*. To do so, run the following commands from the terminal:

.. code:: sh 

  cd ~/Persistent/
  mkdir app_service
  cp securedrop/install_files/ansible-base/app-*ths app_service/
  cp securedrop/install_files/ansible-base/site-specific app_service/

Once you have completed the backup process, you may shut down the *Admin Workstation* and move to the next step: installing a Xenial-based instance. (You will need physical access to the servers and firewall for this step.) 

Step 2: install Xenial
----------------------

Assuming that you are using your existing firewall, or that you've already set up your new firewall following the instructions in :doc:`../network_firewall`, the next step is to connect your candidate *Application* and *Monitor* servers to it and install the Xenial base OS. 

.. caution::
 If you're reusing your existing servers, their storage will be wiped by this step, so make sure your backups are available!

With the servers connected to the firewall, follow the instructions in :doc:`../servers` to install Xenial, overwriting the existing Trusty installation. You should use the same network settings and administrator shell account name as for your previous installation. 

.. note::
 
 if you do not have the network settings or shell username recorded, you'll find them listed in the ``~/Persistent/app_service/site-specific`` file on the  *Admin Workstation*

Step 3: Set up SSH access to the servers
----------------------------------------

Once you have installed Xenial on the servers, you'll need to configure key-based SSH access to the servers from the *Admin Workstation*.

First, connect the *Admin Workstation* directly to the firewall via Ethernet, and start up the *Admin Workstation* with persistence enabled and an administration password set. You may need to update the network settings in Tails to use the static IP that was set up during the firewall configuration for the *Admin Workstation*.

Then, remove the previous instance's connection config from the *Admin Workstation*, by opening a terminal and running the following commands:

.. code:: sh
 
 rm ~/.ssh/{config,known_hosts}
 rm ~/Persistent/securedrop/install_files/ansible-base/app-source-ths
 rm ~/Persistent/securedrop/install_files/ansible-base/app-*-aths
 rm ~/Persistent/securedrop/install_files/ansible-base/mon-*-aths

Next, copy the *Admin Workstation*'s SSH public key to the new servers. To do so, you will need the IP addresses of the servers, and the username and password of the administrator account created during the OS installation. The commands below use the default values, but make sure to substitute your own:

.. code:: sh

 # copy key to app
 ssh-copy-id sdadmin@10.20.2.2

 # copy key to mon
 ssh-copy-id sdadmin@10.20.3.2
 
You will be prompted by both commands for the shell account password.

To confirm that key-based SSH access is working, run the following commands:

.. code:: sh
  
  ssh sdadmin@10.20.2.2 hostname
  ssh sdadmin@10.20.3.2 hostname

In both cases, the commands should return the hostname of the remote server, without requiring a password.


Step 4: Install SecureDrop
--------------------------

Once you have set up SSH access, it's time to install SecureDrop. As most of the application settings are preserved on the *Admin Workstation* from your previous instance, this process will be simpler than your first installation.

First, you'll need make sure your *Admin Workstation*'s SecureDrop application code is up-to-date and validated. From a terminal, run the following commands:

.. code:: sh

 cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
 git checkout 0.12.0
 git tag -v 0.12.0

You should see ``Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"`` in the output of that last command, along with the fingerprint ``"2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"``

.. caution::

 If you do not, signature verification has failed and you should not proceed with the installation. If this happens, please contact us at securedrop@freedom.press.

If the command above returns the expected value, you may proceed with the installation.

First, run the following command to set up the SecureDrop administration environment:

.. code:: sh

  ./securedrop-admin setup

This command may take several minutes to complete and may fail due to Tor network timeouts. If it does fail, try running it again. If it fails repeatedly, :ref:`contact us. <bir_contact_us>` 

Next, step through the SecureDrop application settings to verify that their values are correct. You should not need to change anything - run the following command and press Enter when prompted with the current values:

.. code:: sh

 ./securedrop-admin sdconfig

If the configuration values are correct, you may proceed with the installation using the following command:

.. code:: sh

 ./securedrop-admin install

This command will take several minutes to complete, and will reboot the *Application* and *Monitor* servers as part of the process. If it fails, try running it again. If it fails repeatedly, :ref:`contact us. <bir_contact_us>`

When the server installation completes successfully, you should set up the *Admin Workstation* to connect to the new servers over Tor. To do so, run the following command:

.. code:: sh

 ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

This will update desktop shortcuts and SSH configuration files on the *Admin Workstation*. Once it is complete, you may move on to the next step: restoring the old instance configuration and data from the backup.

Step 5: Restore your instance data and config from backup
---------------------------------------------------------

Before beginning the restore procedure, you should stop and start the Tails network connection using the panel widget in the upper-right corner of the screen. This will force the Tails Tor proxy to load the config changes made by the ``./securedrop-admin tailsconfig`` command. Once Tor has reconnected, you're ready to restore the backup.

To restore from backup, run the following commands in a terminal, substituting the name of the backup file that you created earlier for `sd-backup-<date>.tar.gz`:

.. code:: sh

 cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
 ./securedrop-admin restore sd-backup-<date>.tar.gz

Once the restore process is complete, the previous instance's *Application Server* ATHS and THS files should be copied into place on the *Admin Workstation*. From a terminal, run the following commands:

.. code:: sh

 cd ~/Persistent
 cp app_services/app*ths securedrop/install_files/ansible-base/

Finally, run the ``tailsconfig`` command again to update the *Admin Workstation*'s SSH configuration and desktop shortcuts:

.. code:: sh

 cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
 ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Once the command completes, stop and restart the network connection again to force the Tails Tor proxy to pick up on the configuration changes.

Step 6: Cut over to the new instance
------------------------------------

If you used your existing instance's hardware for the Xenial installation, your new instance is now available, with unchanged Onion URLs. If you installed onto new hardware, you should now power down your old instance hardware and reboot your new instance's servers. Once the reboot is complete, move on to Step 7.

Step 7: Test the instance connectivity
--------------------------------------

Your Xenial-based instance should now be up and running, with the *Journalist* and *Source* interfaces available under their original Onion URLs. To confirm this, use the desktop shortcuts on the *Admin Workstation* to connect to each interface, and log into the *Journalist Interface* using your existing credentials. You should also verify SSH connectivity to the *Application* and *Monitor* servers from a terminal, using the commands ``ssh app`` and ``ssh mon`` respectively.
