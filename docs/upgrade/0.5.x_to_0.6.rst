Upgrade from 0.5.x to 0.6.x
===========================

Updating the Tails Workstations
-------------------------------

All Tails drives should be updated to Tails 3.6, `released
concurrently <https://blog.torproject.org/tails-36-out>`__ with
SecureDrop 0.6. For the *Secure Viewing Station*, *Admin Workstation*
and *Journalist Workstation*, you need `to manually upgrade
<https://tails.boum.org/news/version_3.6/index.en.html#index3h1>`__ as
explained in the `Tails documentation
<https://tails.boum.org/upgrade/index.en.html>`__.

For the *Journalist Workstations* and the *Admin Workstation*, you will also
need to update the SecureDrop code using the following manual method:

.. code:: sh

   cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
   git fetch --tags
   git checkout 0.6
   gpg --recv-key "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
   git tag -v 0.6 # Output should include "Good signature"
   ./securedrop-admin setup

From this point forward, you will be able to use the command 
``securedrop-admin check_for_updates`` to check whether updates are available,
and ``securedrop-admin update`` to check for updates and to apply them in a 
single step.

Troubleshooting Linux Kernel Issues
-----------------------------------

The latest Linux kernel (version 4.4.115) will be automatically installed on your
SecureDrop servers within 24 hours of the 0.6 release (13th of March at
22:00 UTC). If you are using hardware other than 
:ref:`our official hardware recommendations <Specific Hardware Recommendations>`,
you face moderate risk of a SecureDrop outage.

If you are experiencing an outage as part of the 0.6 release (e.g. you
cannot reach the source interface, you cannot SSH into the servers
etc.), you will have to perform the steps outlined below.

First, you need to physically access each server. Power down the server
(safely if possible), attach required peripherals (keyboard, monitor),
and power the server back up. If you did not configure Google
Authenticator for console access, you will need to use single user mode
in order to login to each server.

Boot into Single-User Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |GRUB in default state| image:: ../images/0.5.x_to_0.6/grub-in-default-state.png
.. |GRUB in edit mode| image:: ../images/0.5.x_to_0.6/grub-in-edit-mode.png

To access single user mode, you will have to edit the boot options for
the new kernel. You can do so using the GRUB bootloader, pictured below:

|GRUB in default state|

Press any key quickly just once. You will only have about 2 to 3 seconds
before Ubuntu starts booting. If you miss that window, just log in normally
and reboot safely, provided you can log in. Do not unplug or forcibly 
shut down the server.

Once you hit a key, you will be able to interact with the menu with the
up (⬆) and down (⬇) keys. Select “Ubuntu” as shown above, and press “e”
to edit the boot options. In the line that begins “linux”, replace the
word “quiet” with “single”. Note that the word "quiet" may be wrapped, as in the
screenshot below:

|GRUB in edit mode|

Press the “F10” key to boot.

Test the New Kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Observe the boot process. It is possible that the system will fail to
boot completely; if so, the log information will help us to understand
what is happening.

Provided that you can log in, check if you have network access. Try a
command such as ``sudo host freedom.press``. If you don’t have network
access, it is most likely due to the upgraded kernel missing a network
driver for your hardware.

If everything appears to be operating normally, the outage may not be
kernel-related. In that case, please still follow the steps at the end of
this document to send us log information along with an issue report,
and we will help you investigate.

If you are experiencing network issues or other kernel problems, we
recommend that you roll back to an older kernel, and that you report the
issue to us immediately. 

Compare the Behavior of the Old Kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. |GRUB with advanced options selected| image:: ../images/0.5.x_to_0.6/grub-with-advanced-options-selected.png

Reboot the server in a safe way with ``sudo reboot``. After the BIOS screen,
you can select a new kernel from the GRUB boot menu by selecting
**Advanced Options for Ubuntu**, pictured below.

|GRUB with advanced options selected|

Under **Advanced Options**, choose the option with kernel version ``3.14.x-grsec``.
As before, you may need to edit the kernel options to enter single user
mode. The boot process should proceed normally. Wait until you get a
login prompt and log in.

Once you are logged in, check to see if you have network access. If you do, then  
your instance is having an issue with the 4.x kernel. In that case, we need to 
temporarily set an older kernel as the default.

Roll Back to the Old Kernel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important:: The older kernel has reached end of life, so it
  is of critical importance for the near term security of your instance
  that we work together to resolve any compatibility issues. Rolling back to an 
  older version is only a stopgap measure to avoid a prolonged outage of your
  SecureDrop instance.

Inspect the file ``/boot/grub/grub.cfg``. You should find a ``menuentry`` line
with the same text that you selected during boot, e.g.:

.. code:: sh

  submenu 'Advanced options for Ubuntu'…

    menuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 3.14.xx-grsec…

Take note of its position among the other submenu entries (it will most likely
be third). Then edit the GRUB configuration:

.. code:: sh

  sudo vim /etc/default/grub

Make a backup of the file or take a note of the current value of
``GRUB_DEFAULT`` somewhere, so you can restore the previous behavior easily at a
later point.

Once you have done so, set the ``GRUB_DEFAULT`` variable to point to the index
of the  menu and submenu. Note that the index starts at 0, so for a typical
setup, the line in ``/etc/default/grub`` would look like this:

.. code:: sh

  GRUB_DEFAULT=”1>2”

The “1” means the second entry of the main menu (“Advanced options”),
the “2” means the third entry of the submenu. Again, update these
numbers consistent with your configuration. 


.. caution:: Ensure that you have chosen the right index for the main menu
  and the submenu, and double-check that you are beginning the count at 0, not
  1; otherwise, you may boot into the wrong kernel.

This change still has to be applied to take effect on the next boot:

.. code:: sh

  sudo update-grub2

Now you can reboot into the old, working kernel.

.. code:: sh

  sudo reboot

The server should come up automatically. From here on, you should be
able to perform all administrative tasks via SSH as usual. If you want
additional confirmation of the kernel version, the command 
``uname -r`` should display ``3.14.79-grsec``.

Please notify us of the compatibility issue so we can help you resolve it ASAP.

Report Compatibility Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have encountered issues with the kernel upgrade, it is important
that you report them to us so that we may incorporate any necessary
changes to our updated kernel, and so that we can work with you to
switch back to the new kernel as soon as possible.

Run the following commands via SSH from the *Admin Workstation*:

.. code:: sh

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop/
  source .venv/bin/activate
  cd install_files/ansible-base
  ansible all -b -m setup > server-facts.log

Please also send us a copy of ``/var/log/syslog`` and ``/var/log/dmesg`` for
analysis.

You can share ``server-facts.log``, ``syslog`` and ``dmesg`` with us as follows:

-  If you are a member of our Support Portal, please create a new issue
   and attach the files to it.
-  Alternatively, email us at securedrop@freedom.press 
   (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__) 
   with the subject “SecureDrop kernel facts” and the files attached.

Once we get your information, we can try to provide assistance to
resolve compatibility issues.
