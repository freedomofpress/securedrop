Upgrade from 0.6.x to 0.7.x
===========================

Updating the Tails workstations
-------------------------------

All Tails drives should be updated to Tails 3.7, which is scheduled to be 
released on May 9, 2018. Follow the graphical prompts on your workstations to
perform this upgrade.

For the *Journalist Workstations* and the *Admin Workstation*, you will also
need to update the SecureDrop code (which configures the workstation
environment, such as the SecureDrop shortcuts on the Tails desktop). First,
ensure that you have  `set a Tails administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/index.en.html>`__.
Then, on the workstation to be updated, perform the following steps in a
terminal:

.. code:: sh

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --recv-key "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 0.7.0

The output should include the following two lines:

.. code:: sh

  gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
  gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what you 
see on the screen of your *Admin Workstation*. If it does, you can check out the
new release:

.. code:: sh

  git checkout 0.7.0

Finally, run the following commands:

.. code:: sh

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Going forward, the SecureDrop Workstation Updater user interface will appear
when  updates are needed upon boot of a workstation. Users only need to click 
"Update Now" instead of performing the steps described above. The SecureDrop
Workstation Updater looks as follows:

.. |SecureDrop updater| image:: ../images/0.6.x_to_0.7/securedrop-updater.png

Configuring SSH over the local network
--------------------------------------

SecureDrop 0.7.0 ships with the option to SSH into the SecureDrop servers over the
local network instead of the Tor network. Please see the :doc:`detailed documentation <../ssh_over_local_net>`
for this feature.

Configuring email alerts about new submissions
----------------------------------------------

SecureDrop 0.7.0 allows you to configure an encrypted daily email alert informing
you about  whether or not there are new SecureDrop submissions. In order to
configure this feature, you will need an email address that should receive 
alerts, a public GPG key to use for that address, and the fingerprint for that
key.

Note that you cannot configure multiple email addresses. If you would like the
alerts to be sent to multiple users, you will have to set up a single email
alias for this purpose, and all recipients will need to have access to a shared
GPG key.

To set up the alerts, on your *Admin Workstation*, copy the public key (e.g.,
``journalist.pub``) to
``~/Persistent/securedrop/install_files/ansible-base/``.

Within ``~/Persistent/securedrop``, run ``./securedrop-admin sdconfig``
and follow the prompts. For this functionality, you will be prompted for
the following values (default is none, as the functionality is disabled
by default):

-  Journalist public key (e.g., ``journalist.pub``)
-  Journalist GPG key fingerprint
-  Journalist email address

Run ``./securedrop-admin install`` and wait for it to complete. The
configured email address should now receive an encrypted notification
email every 24 hours.

Configuring server reboot time
------------------------------

SecureDrop 0.7.0 lets you configure the time of day (full hour) at which the
SecureDrop servers are rebooted.

To do so, run  ``./securedrop-admin sdconfig`` on your *Admin Workstation* 
within  ``~/Persistent/securedrop``, and follow the prompts. For this 
functionality, you will be prompted for "Daily reboot time of the server (24-hour
clock)". Specify the desired local time, e.g., type "18" for 6 PM. Then run 
``./securedrop-admin install`` to apply the change to the  servers.
