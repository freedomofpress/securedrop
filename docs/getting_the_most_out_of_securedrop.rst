Promoting Your SecureDrop Instance
==================================

At Freedom of the Press Foundation, we’ve found news organizations that get the
most out of SecureDrop are those who promote it regularly and effectively.
SecureDrop will only be used by sources if they know it exists, so it’s best
to promote its use in a variety of ways so that a wide swath of people will see
it.

So here are a few tips used by some of the news outlets that have seen the most
success with SecureDrop.

Make a High Profile Announcement
--------------------------------

Anytime you launch a SecureDrop, you’ll want to write an accompanying news story
along with it to alert your readers and potential sources where to submit
information. Almost every news organization already does this, but some good recent
examples come from `USA Today`_, `The Guardian`_, and `Wired`_. You can also write a
companion Q & A like the `Washington Post`_ did.

However, a launch announcement is really just a small piece of the puzzle. It’s
important to regularly remind readers and potential sources that your SecureDrop
exists, because only a tiny fraction will likely see the launch announcement and
it will quickly be buried in other news after a couple of days.

Provide a Clear Link on Your Homepage
-------------------------------------

Making your SecureDrop or secure tips page easy to find is one of the most important
things you can do to ensure that potential sources use it. The best way you can do
this is providing a clear link on your home page, so that every time a user goes
to your website, they can quickly see where they need to go.

For example, the Intercept has a "become a source” link in its main menu:

|The Intercept Become A Source|

The Washington Post has a link on their front page for “how to share a tip securely”:

|How to Share a Tip Securely|

Other news organizations put a little link in their footer, however, we’ve found
that this is not as effective as putting it in a more prominent on your front page.

Provide Links at the Bottom of Your Articles
--------------------------------------------

Another great way to remind potential sources know that they can use SecureDrop is
to put a link at the bottom of each article. For example, Gizmodo Media Group,
uses a message like this:

|Gizmodo Article Footer|

Create an Instructional Video on How to Access and Use Your SecureDrop
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To better help potential sources visualize how SecureDrop works, several
organizations have made short instructional videos walking through all the steps.
Some good examples include the `Toronto Globe and Mail`_, The Intercept, and
`Lucy Parsons Labs`_.

Regularly Share Your SecureDrop *Landing Page* on Social Media
--------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of adults in the United States now get their news from Facebook or
other social media sites like Twitter, so it’s important to regularly remind
people via social media posts that SecureDrop is the safest way they can contact
your journalists if they have a sensitive tip to share. If there’s specific
stories you are looking for tips on that may already be in the news, this is a
great way of getting added attention to your SecureDrop.

Target Potential Whistleblowers with Advertising
------------------------------------------------

Facebook and Twitter also allow for targeted advertising to users in specific
locations, attributes, and sometimes even specific users. For example, Gizmodo Media Group
targeted online advertisements for their secure tips page at DC residents
imploring them to `tell on trump`_. At Freedom of the Press Foundation, we ran a
proof of concept Twitter advertisement aimed at EPA and NOAA employees to show
how it can be done. You can read about `how you can do the same thing here`_.

Put an Advertisement in Your Physical Paper
-------------------------------------------

Obviously this tip only applies to news outlets that also print a physical
newspaper, but putting an ad or in the paper to tell readers where to go to
access SecureDrop can be extremely effective.

The New York Times took out a full page ad in their own paper when they
launched SecureDrop and other secure communications tools for their tips line:

|New York Times Tweet|

And the Toronto Globe and Mail regularly puts a note in their physical paper
reminding potential sources where they can go:
