Sample SecureDrop Privacy Policy
================================

**[DATE]**

SecureDrop strives to create a more secure environment for whistleblowers to
give information to journalists. It was installed at **[MEDIA ORG]** with the
help of Freedom of the Press Foundation.

Please read this privacy policy carefully. It explains what information what
type of information SecureDrop does and does not collect, and why.

Collection of Information From Sources
--------------------------------------

* We don’t ask or require you to provide any personally identifying information
  when you submit materials through SecureDrop.

* The system does not record your IP address, information about your browser,
  computer, or operating system. Furthermore, the SecureDrop pages do not embed
  third-party content or deliver persistent cookies to your browser.

* The server will only store the date and time of the newest message sent from
  each source. Once you send a new message, the time and date of your previous
  message is automatically deleted.

* Journalists decrypt and read each message offline. They are encouraged to
  delete messages from the server on a regular basis. The date and time of any
  message will be securely deleted from the server when the message is deleted.

* Please keep in mind that the actual messages you send and receive through
  SecureDrop may include personally identifying information. For this reason,
  once you read a journalist’s message, we recommend you delete it. It will
  then be securely deleted from the file system.

Also please note that when you submit certain types of files through SecureDrop,
you may be sending us metadata associated with that file.

For example, if you submit a photo through SecureDrop in JPEG format, the
file may include information about the date, time, and the GPS location of where
it was taken, and the type of device used to take the photo. Similarly, if you
submit a Word file (.doc or .docx) through SecureDrop, it may include the
identity of the document’s author, the author’s operating system, GPS data about
the author’s location, and the date and time when the document was created.

Our policy is to scrub metadata from the files we receive through SecureDrop
before publication. If you don’t want to send us metadata, please use the
Metadata Anonymization Toolkit to scrub the file before you submit it.

Collection of Information About Journalists’ Use of SecureDrop
--------------------------------------------------------------

**[MEDIA ORG]** collects information about journalists’ use of SecureDrop for
security monitoring and to make sure the system works properly.

This information we collect about journalists includes details about the device,
browser, and operating system journalists use when accessing the system, and the
date and time of each session.

We retain these access logs for **[___]** days, and then delete them.

Data Security
-------------

**[MEDIA ORG]** works diligently to protect the identities of our sources and
keep the information they give us confidential.

SecureDrop servers are under the physical control of **[MEDIA ORG]** and do
not share common elements of the **[MEDIA ORG'S]** other infrastructure.

However, no one can truly guarantee 100% security of any system. Like all
software, SecureDrop may contain bugs. Ultimately, you use the SecureDrop
service at your own risk.

Children Under 13
-----------------

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act restricts our ability to collect
personal information from children under 13. This site is not directed to
children 12 or younger.

Changes to This Policy
----------------------

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version
of the policy will govern our collection and use of personal information and
will always be at **[LINK]**. If we make changes that we believe are material, we
will prominently display a notice on our site **[___]** days before we make those
changes.
