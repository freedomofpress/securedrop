For SecureDrop workstation updates, beginning with SecureDrop 0.7.0,
your workstation will automatically check for updates on boot. An update
window will pop up when updates are needed, and you should simply follow the prompts
in the updater to perform the update.

.. note:: Note that you will need to have a `Tails
  Administrator password`_ configured to complete the update. If you forget to
  do so, you will need to reboot to enable it.

   password`: https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/
