.. note:: SecureDrop maintains two branches of documentation, `stable
          <https://docs.securedrop.org/en/stable/development/getting_started.html>`_
          and `latest
          <https://docs.securedrop.org/en/latest/development/getting_started.html>`_,
          the former being the default used by our Read the Docs powered site.
          ``stable`` is built from our latest signed git tag, while ``latest``
          is built from the head of the ``develop`` git branch.  In almost all
          cases involving development work, you'll want to make sure you have
          the ``latest`` version selected by clicking the appropriate link
          above, or by using the menu in the bottom left corner.
