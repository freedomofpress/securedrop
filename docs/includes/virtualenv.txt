.. note:: You can install, upgrade, and remove packages using the program ``pip`` in an isolated environment. You can use ``venv`` or ``virtualenv`` to avoid installing Python             packages globally and isolate the installation of dependencies of a specific application, so that the dependencies of another application do not interfere. 
          
          Run the command ``python3 -m venv .venv`` to create and manage your virtual environment. To begin using the virtual 
          environment, use the command ``source .venv/bin/activate`` to activate.   
        
          You can also use `virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ which provides the    
          ``mkvirtualenv`` shell function and is a set of extensions to the ``virtualenv`` tool. The extensions include wrappers for 
          creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow.
