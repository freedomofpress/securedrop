.. note:: Ensure you are running in a virtual environment, so you can install, upgrade, and       
          remove packages using the program `pip`. Run the command `python3 -m venv .venv` to create and manage your virtual environments. To begin using the virtual environmen, use the command `source venv/bin/activate` to activate.   
        
          You can also use `virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_ which provides the `mkvirtualenv` shell function and is a set of extensions to the `virtualenv` tool. The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow.
