.. note:: You can install, upgrade, and remove Python packages using ``pip``,
          the Python package installer. By default, ``pip`` will attempt to
          install packages system-wide. Use ``venv`` or ``virtualenv`` to avoid
          installing Python packages globally and to isolate the installation of
          dependencies of a specific application.

          Run the command ``python3 -m venv .venv`` to create and manage your
          virtual environment. To begin using the virtual environment, use the
          command ``source .venv/bin/activate`` to activate.

          You can also use `virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_
          which provides the ``mkvirtualenv`` shell function and is a set of
          extensions to the ``virtualenv`` tool. The extensions include wrappers
          for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing
          your development workflow.
