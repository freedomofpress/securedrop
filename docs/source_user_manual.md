# How To Use SecureDrop As A Source

## SecureDrop Depends on the Tor Browser

Sources submitting documents or messages to SecureDrop must connect to the SecureDrop Interface using the Tor network, free software that makes users' internet activity much more difficult to trace. The easiest and most secure way to use Tor is to download the Tor Browser Bundle from https://www.torproject.org/. This bundle installs the Tor browser, as well as an application that is used to connect to the Tor network.

The Tor Browser can be used to access Tor _hidden service URLs_, which have domain names that end in ".onion". Media organizations will provide links to the .onion URLs of their SecureDrop pages, and we [maintain a list](https://freedom.press/securedrop/directory) of official pages as well. Sources can and should use the [Tails operating system](https://tails.boum.org) for a higher level of security.

## Using SecureDrop As a Source

Open the Tor Browser and navigate to the .onion hidden service URL provided by the media organization whose SecureDrop page you would like to visit. The page should look similar to the screenshot below. If this is the first time you're using the Tor browser, it's likely that you have Javascript enabled. If you do, you will see the red warning below which will explain that this is a security risk. If you don't have Javascript enabled, you can skip the next step.

Click the `Learn how to disable it` link on the Javascript warning and a message will pop up explaining how to disable Javascript. Follow the instructions and refresh the page if it does not happen automatically.

The page should now look similar to the screenshot below. If this is the first time you are using SecureDrop, click the `Submit Documents` button.

You should now see a screen that shows the unique codename that SecureDrop has generated for you. In the example screenshot below the codename is `sink los radium bcd nab privy nadir`, but yours will be different. It is extremely important that you both remember this code and keep it secret. After submitting documents, you will need to provide this code to log back in and check for responses.

The best way to protect your codename is to memorize it. If you cannot memorize it right away, we recommend writing it down and keeping it in a safe place at first, and gradually working to memorize it over time. Once you have memorized it, you should destroy the written copy.

SecureDrop allows you to choose the length of your codename, in case you want to create a longer codename for extra security. Once you have generated a codename and put it somewhere safe, click `Continue`.

You will next be brought to the submission interface, where you may upload a document, enter a message to send to journalists, or both. You can only submit one document at a time, so you may want to combine several files into a zip archive if necessary. The maximum submission size is currently 500MB. If the files you wish to upload are over that limit, we recommend that you send a message to the journalist explaining this, so that they can set up another method for transferring the documents.

When your submission is ready, click `Submit`.

After clicking `Submit`, a confirmation page should appear, showing that your message and/or documents have been sent successfully. On this page you can make another submission or view responses to your previous messages.

If you have already submitted a document and would like to check for responses, click the `Check for a Response` button on the media organization's SecureDrop homepage.

The next page will ask for your secret codename. Enter it and click `Continue`.

If a journalist has responded, his or her message will appear on the next page. This page also allows you to upload another document or send another message to the journalist. Be sure to delete any messages here before navigating away.

![Check for a reply](/docs/images/manual/source-step9.png)

After you delete the message from the journalist, make sure you see the below message.

If the server experiences a large number of new sources signing up at once and is overloaded with submissions, the journalist will flag your message on their end and you will see the message below. They can't write a reply to you until you've seen this message for security reasons. This will only happen the first time a journalist replies and with subsequent replies you will skip this step. Click `Refresh` or log in again to see if a journalist has responded.

Repeat these steps to continue communicating with the journalist.
