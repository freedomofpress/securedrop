Using a YubiKey with the *Journalist Interface*
===============================================

This guide describes in detail how to set up a YubiKey for two-factor
authentication on the *Journalist Interface*. This setup is performed
once per journalist to create a secure log-in method. The process
requires some configuration steps using a separate software tool.

.. note:: You will do all of these steps from within the Tails
          operating system.

What is a YubiKey?
------------------

A YubiKey is a physical token used for two-factor authentication. They
are made by a company called Yubico and are `commercially available`_.

Download and Launch the YubiKey Personalization Tool
----------------------------------------------------

#. Start Tails. At the log in-screen, choose the option to allow an
   administrator passphrase.
#. Open a terminal and enter

.. code:: sh

   sudo apt-get update;
   sudo apt-get install yubikey-personalization-gui
   
#. Once you have downloaded and installed the personalization program,
   open a **Root Terminal** by choosing **Applications ▸ System Tools
   ▸ Root Terminal**.

#. Open the YubiKey personalization tool by entering

.. code:: sh

   yubikey-personalization-gui

Setting Up Hardware-Based Codes
-------------------------------

After opening the personalization tool, click the heading
**OATH-HOTP**. This will bring you to a window called **Program in
OATH-HTOP mode**.

Click on the **Quick** button.

|YubiKey Overview|

Under **Configuration Slot**, click **Configuration Slot 1**.

.. note:: If you are already using this YubiKey for something else,
          you should choose **Configuration Slot 2**. You will have to
          press and hold for several seconds to use the token from
          **Slot 2** instead of the one in **Slot 1**. See the
          `YubiKey manual`_ for more information.

.. _`Yubikey manual`: https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/YubiKeyManual_v3.4.pdf

In the section titled **OATH-HOTP parameters**, uncheck the box for
**OATH Token Identifier (6 bytes)**. Next, uncheck the box for **Hide
secret**. This will display the **Secret Key (20 bytes Hex)**
field.

.. important:: Make a note somewhere safe of the **Secret Key (20
               bytes Hex)** value.

|YubiKey Config|

When ready, click the **Write Configuration** button.

Click through the warning about overwriting the configuration slot and
choose a location to save the log file. When the configuration is
done, you should see green text saying **YubiKey configured** at the
top of the window.

Adding Users
------------

When adding new users, a SecureDrop administrator will need the
**Secret Key** value described above. She will enter it after
selecting the **I'm Using a YubiKey** option while :ref:`adding users
<Adding Users>`.

Using Your YubiKey
------------------

When using a Yubikey to log-in to the *Journalist Interface*, insert
the Yubikey into the USB port and enter your username and
passphrase. Then click the **Two-factor Code** field to focus the
cursor there. Quickly press the lighted button on your YubiKey. This
will insert the 6-digit code that you will need to log in.

.. note:: When using **Configuration Slot 2**, be sure to press and hold
          the YubiKey button for approximately 3 seconds.
