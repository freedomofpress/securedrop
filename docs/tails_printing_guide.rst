Setting up a Printer in Tails
=============================

Because Tails is supposed to be as "amnesiac" as possible, you want to
shield your Tails stick from any extra inputs from, and outputs to, a
potentially untrusted network. This is why **we strongly recommend using
a printer that does not have WiFi or Bluetooth**, and hooking up to it
using a regular USB cable to print.

Finding a printer that works with Tails can be challenging because Tails is
based on the Linux operating system, which often has second-class hardware
support in comparison to operating systems such as Windows or macOS.

We :ref:`maintain a list of printers <printers_tested_by_fpf>` that we have
personally tested and gotten to work with Tails, in the Hardware guide; if
possible, we recommend using one of those printers. The Linux Foundation also
maintains the `OpenPrinting database <https://www.openprinting.org/printers>`_,
which documents the compatibility, or lack thereof, of numerous printers from
most every manufacturer.

.. note:: The latest generations of printers might or might not be represented
          by the OpenPrinting database; also, the database does not document
          whether or not a printer is wireless, so this will involve manually
          checking models of interest, if you wish to use this resource as a
          guide for purchasing a non-wireless printer suitable for use with
          SecureDrop.

With that in mind, this database is arguably the best resource for researching
the compatibility of printers with Linux. As a tip for narrowing down your
search, look for printers that are compatible with Debian, or Debian-based
distributions like Ubuntu, since Tails itself is also Debian-based. This might
increase the chances for a seamless installation experience in Tails.

In any case, this document outlines the usual set of steps that we follow when
attempting to use a new printer with Tails, and provides some troubleshooting
tips that you may find useful if you are trying to use a different printer.

.. note:: While, as of Tails 3, it's no longer necessary to have admin
   privileges in order to install or configure printers, we recommend that you
   set an admin passphrase along with
   :ref:`enabling persistence <enable_persistence_in_tails>`; this ensures that
   the printer's installation and configuration settings persist after every
   reboot, so you don't have to reinstall it each time you start Tails.

Installing and Printing via the Tails GUI
-----------------------------------------

Let's look at Tails 3.0's typical flow for installing a USB-connected printer.
If you've enabled persistence, boot with your persistent volume, and set an
admin passphrase. Connect the printer to your Tails-booted computer via USB,
then turn the printer on.

Now, you'll want to single-click your way through **Applications** ▸
**System Tools** ▸ **Settings** ▸ **Printers**.

|select printer from settings|

In this example, we'll assume that this is the first time we've tried to install
a printer, which will show the following:

|add printer|

Click "Add a Printer". By doing so, you'll now get a list of printers that Tails
has auto-detected. You should now see this:

|select printer to add|

In this example, we've connected an HP DeskJet F4200. Clicking on this printer
will select it for installation, which, if successful, will display the
following:

|printer installing|

This indicates the Tails is attempting to install the USB printer; assuming you
receive no errors in this process, you will then see the following screen,
which indicates that the printer is "ready" for printing.

|printer ready|

Troubleshooting
---------------

For instances where your printer does *not* work out of the box, most difficulties
stem from not selecting the right driver (extra software needed for the printer
and computer to communicate). Luckily, Tails has a large number of drivers for
just about any popularly manufactured printer on hand, without even having to
download new drivers from the web.

Just as before, if you've enabled persistence, boot with your persistent
volume, and set an admin passphrase.

Make sure your computer is NOT connected to the Internet. This will make
sure that your printer set-up is never influenced by a network connection.

|no network connection required|

Plug in your printer and navigate to Printing. **Applications** ▸ **System
Tools** ▸ **Settings** ▸ **Printing**.

|navigate to Printing|

Click **Add**.

|add new printer|

Immediately, Tails will recognize the plugged-in printer, and make the
best suggestion from its on-board database of printer drivers.

|searching for drivers...|

Tails will guide you through a default set-up, suggesting the best match
for the printer you have. These choices come from Tails' pre-installed
driver database.

|default set up 1|

|default set up 2|

The recommended driver does not always match the actual make and model
of your printer, but starting with the recommendations is a good idea.
Sometimes you get lucky, and Tails suggests a perfect match. Click
**Forward**, and **Apply** your settings.

|apply settings|

You'll notice that the printer is now listed in your Printing
Configurations in your persistent storage.

|add your printer|

The only way to be sure you have the right driver is by doing a test
print. Right-click on your new printer config and select **Properties** to
open its settings, then click **Print Test Page**.

|select "Properties"|

|print a test page|

In this initial test, the recommended driver was wrong! My test page
came out garbled, and my printer gave me a warning that I had to
manually clear before the page printed.

|garbled test print|

|warning light indicator|

Don't worry if this happens to you; you can edit the printer
configuration to point it to the correct driver for your model. Select
**Properties** again and choose **Change...** next to the "Make and Model"
directive.

|change make and model|

To fix this problem, I selected the CUPS + Gutenprint driver, even
though it wasn't recommended. Click **Forward** to save your changes.

|custom choice for make and model|

Do another test print, checking your printer for indicators that it's
working or not. This time, printing works perfectly. If you still
experience garbled text, try another driver from your selections. It is
a process of trial-and-error.

|perfect test print|

Printing from the Command Line
------------------------------

You can also easily print from the command line using the ``lp`` command; if
you haven't already set your installed printer as default in the GUI, you can
quickly do so by adding this line to your ``~/.bashrc`` file, or entering this
directly into the terminal:

.. code:: sh

   export PRINTER=Printer-Name-Here

If you need to find the name of the printer, you can use ``lpstat`` to get a
list of installed printers, as such:

.. code:: sh

   lpstat -a

Once you've set your default printer, you can easily print from the terminal by
using the following syntax:

.. code:: sh

   lp filename.extension

While printing from the GUI is much easier, once you've got everything set up,
it's equally straightforward from the command line, if you prefer that
environment.
