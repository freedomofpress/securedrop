Create an Admin Account on the *Journalist Interface*
=====================================================

In order for any user (admin or journalist) to access the
*Journalist Interface*, they need:

1. The ``auth-cookie`` for the *Journalist Interface*'s ATHS
2. An account on the *Journalist Interface*, which requires the following
   credentials to log in:

   * Username
   * Passphrase
   * Two-factor authentication code

You should create a separate account on the *Journalist Interface* for
each user who needs access. This makes it easy to enable or disable
access to the *Journalist Interface* on an individual basis, so you can
grant access to new users or revoke access for users who have left the
organization or should no longer be allowed to access the Journalist
Interface.

There are two types of accounts on the *Journalist Interface*: admin
accounts and normal accounts. Admins accounts are like normal
accounts, but they are additionally allowed to manage (add, change,
delete) other user accounts through the web interface.

You must create the first admin account on the *Journalist Interface* by
running a command on the *Application Server*. After that, the Journalist
Interface admin can create additional accounts through the web
interface.

If you are installing SecureDrop yourself, to create the first admin account, :doc:`SSH to the Application Server <test_the_installation>`, then:

.. code:: sh

   sudo -u www-data bash
   cd /var/www/securedrop
   ./manage.py add-admin

Follow the prompts.

A secure diceware passphrase will be generated by `manage.py`. You will see
output like this:

.. highlight:: none
.. code::

    This journalist's passphrase is: delivery propose requisite stunner dragonfly unstamped stowaway

Passphrases include the spaces between the words, but not leading or trailing
whitespace. Be sure to save this passphrase in the appropriate KeePassXC database.

Once that's done, you should open the Tor Browser |TorBrowser| and
navigate to the *Journalist Interface*'s .onion address. Verify that you
can log in to the *Journalist Interface* with the admin account you just
created.

For adding more user accounts, please refer now to our :doc:`Admin
Interface Guide <admin>`.

.. note:: You can now set a custom logo image on your web interfaces by
           following the :ref:`Updating Logo Image` documentation.
