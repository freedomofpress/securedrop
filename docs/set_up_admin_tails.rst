Set up the Admin Workstation
============================

Earlier, you should have created the *admin Tails USB* along with a
persistence volume for it. Now, we are going to add a couple more
features to the *admin Tails USB* to facilitate SecureDrop's setup.

If you have not switched to and booted the *admin Tails USB* on your
regular workstation, do so now.

Start Tails with Persistence Enabled
------------------------------------

After you boot the *admin Tails USB* on your normal workstation, you
should see a *Welcome to Tails* screen with two options. Select *Yes* to
enable the persistent volume and enter your password, but do NOT click
Login yet. Under 'More Options," select *Yes* and click *Forward*.

Enter an *Administration password* for use with this specific Tails
session and click *Login*.

.. note:: The *Administration password* is a one-time password. It
	  will reset every time you shut down Tails.

After Tails finishes booting, make sure you're connected to the
Internet |Network| and that the Tor's Vidalia indicator onion
|Vidalia| is green, using the icons in the upper right corner.

.. _Download the SecureDrop repository:

Download the SecureDrop repository
----------------------------------

The rest of the SecureDrop-specific configuration is assisted by files
stored in the SecureDrop Git repository. We're going to be using this
again once SecureDrop is installed, but you should download it now. To
get started, open a terminal |Terminal|. You will use this Terminal
throughout the rest of the install process.

Start by running the following commands to download the git repository.

.. code:: sh

    cd ~/Persistent
    git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop.git

.. note:: Since the repository is fairly large and Tor can be slow,
	  this may take a few minutes.


Verify the Release Tag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, download and verify the *Freedom of the Press Foundation Master
Signing Key*. When passing the full public key fingerprint to the
:code:`--recv-key` command, GPG will implicitly verify that the
fingerprint of the key received matches the argument passed.

.. code:: sh

    gpg --keyserver hkp://qdigse2yzvuglcix.onion --recv-key B89A29DB2128160B8E4B1B4CBADDE0C7FC9F6818

.. caution:: If the fingerprint does not match, fingerprint
	     verification has failed and you **should not** proceed
	     with the installation. If this happens, please contact us
	     at securedrop@freedom.press.

Verify that the current release tag was signed with the master signing
key.

.. code:: sh

    cd securedrop/
    git checkout 0.3.6
    git tag -v 0.3.6

You should see ``Good signature from "Freedom of the Press Foundation
Master Signing Key"`` in the output of that last command.

.. caution:: If you do not, signature verification has failed and you
	     *should not* proceed with the installation. If this
	     happens, please contact us at securedrop@freedom.press.

Create the Admin Passphrase Database
------------------------------------

We provide a KeePassX password database template to make it easier for
admins and journalists to generate strong, unique passphrases and
store them securely. Once you have set up Tails with persistence and
have cloned the repo, you can set up your personal password database
using this template.

You can find the template in ``tails_files/securedrop-keepassx.xml``
in the SecureDrop repository that you just cloned.

.. warning:: You will not be able to access your passwords if you
	     forget the master password or the location of the key
	     file used to protect the database.

To use the template:

-  Open the KeePassX program |KeePassX| which is already installed on
   Tails
-  Select **File**, **Import from...**, and **KeePassX XML (*.xml)**
-  Navigate to the location of **securedrop-keepassx.xml**, select it,
   and click **Open**
-  Set a strong master password to protect the password database (you
   will have to write this down/memorize it)
-  Click **File** and **Save Database As**
-  Save the database in the Persistent folder
