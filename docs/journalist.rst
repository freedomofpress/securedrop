Journalist Guide
================

.. include:: ./includes/provide-feedback.txt

This guide presents an overview of the SecureDrop system for a
journalist. It covers the core functions necessary to start working
with the platform: logging in securely, viewing documents, editing
documents, and interacting with sources.

Updating Your Workstation
-------------------------

You should keep your SecureDrop workstations updated with:

* **Tails updates**
* **SecureDrop workstation updates**

You should apply Tails updates to your Tails drive as they are released, as
they often contain critical security fixes. The *Journalist Workstation* Tails
drive, once booted and connected to Tor, will alert you if upgrades are
available. For most Tails upgrades, you can simply follow the steps in the
Tails Upgrader that appears on screen to update your Tails drive. However,
sometimes Tails upgrades are "manual," which means that you should follow the
instructions in the `Tails Upgrade Documentation`_ to upgrade the drives. Talk
to your SecureDrop administrator if you have trouble.

.. include:: includes/update-gui.txt

.. _`Tails
   Upgrade Documentation`: https://tails.boum.org/doc/upgrade/index.en.html

Connecting to the *Journalist Interface*
----------------------------------------
Journalists viewing documents on SecureDrop must connect to the
*Journalist Interface* using the `Tails operating system
<https://tails.boum.org/>`__ on a USB drive. As part of your on-boarding, your
admin should have provided you with a Tails drive configured for this purpose,
known as the *Journalist Workstation* USB drive.

If you do not have a USB drive clearly identified as the *Journalist
Workstation*, ask your administrator for assistance before continuing.

.. note:: The Tails OS makes using SecureDrop very different from
          other computing experiences. The added layers of security
          mean extra steps each time you want to login. With practice,
          you will become increasingly comfortable with the process.

To use the *Journalist Interface*, you will visit a Tor Onion Service address
in the Tor Browser. By design, this Onion Service address is only accessible
from your *Journalist Workstation*; it will not work in Tor Browser on another
computer, unless explicitly configured with an access token.

To visit the *Journalist Interface*, click the *Journalist Interface* icon on
the desktop. This will open Tor Browser to an ".onion" address. Log in with
your username, passphrase, and two-factor authentication token, as
shown in the first screenshot below. (If you have been provided with a YubiKey,
see :doc:`Using YubiKey with the Journalist Interface <yubikey_setup>` for
detailed setup and usage information.)

|Journalist Interface Login|

Reset Passphrase or Two-factor Authentication Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If necessary, journalists may reset their user passphrase or two-factor
authentication token in their user profile. To navigate to your user profile,
log in to the *Journalist Interface* and click on the link in the upper right
of the screen where it says **Logged on as <your user name>.**

If you have lost or forgotten your passphrase or your two-factor device (i.e.
your mobile phone or security key), you will need to contact your SecureDrop
admin for assistance.

|Journalist account profile|

.. _daily_journalist_alerts:


Daily Journalist Alerts About Submissions
-----------------------------------------

When a SecureDrop has little activity and receives only a few
submissions every other week, checking the *Journalist Interface*
daily only to find there is nothing is a burden. It is more convenient
for journalists to be notified daily via encrypted email about whether
or not there has been submission activity in the past 24 hours.

If the email shows submissions were received, the journalist can
connect to the *Journalist Interface* to get them.

This is an optional feature that must be activated :doc:`by the
administrator <admin>`. In the simplest case a journalist provides
their email and GPG public key to the admin. If a team of journalist
wants to receive these daily alerts, they should share a GPG key and
ask the admin to setup a mail alias (SecureDrop does not provide that
service) so they all receive the alerts and are able to decrypt them.

Interacting With Sources
------------------------

If any sources have uploaded documents or sent messages, they will be
listed on the homepage by codename.

|Journalist Interface|

.. note:: Codenames that journalists see are different than the
          codenames visible to sources.

Click on a codename to see the dedicated page for that source. You
will see all of the messages that they have written and documents that
they have uploaded. If the name of a source is difficult to say or
remember, you can rename a source using the **Change codename** link
next to their current codename.

|Cycle source codename|

.. tip:: You can also **Star** interesting or promising sources to
         easily return to them later. All starred sources will be bumped to the
         top of the list of sources.

If you want to reply to the source, write your message in the text
field and click **Submit**.

|Sent reply|

Once your reply has been successfully submitted, you will be returned
to the source page and see a message confirming that the reply was
stored. The source will see your reply the next time they log in with
their unique codename.

To minimize the impact of a source codename being compromised, the *Source
Interface* encourages the source to delete the reply after reading it. Once a
source has read your reply and deleted it from their inbox, a checkmark will
appear next to the reply in the interface.

.. note:: Prior to SecureDrop 0.9.0, replies when deleted from the source inbox
  would also disappear from the journalist inbox. As such, if there are older
  conversations, there may be discontinuities in the conversation.

You may also delete replies if you change your mind after sending them.

Documents and messages are encrypted to the SecureDrop installation's
*Submission Public Key*. In order to read the messages or look at the documents
you will need to transfer them to the *Secure Viewing Station*, which holds
the *Submission Private Key*. To recall the conversation history between your
organization and sources, you can also download replies and transfer them to
the *Secure Viewing Station* for decryption.

Flag for Reply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the server experiences a large number of new sources signing up at
once and is overloaded with submissions, you will need to flag sources
for reply before you can communicate with them. Click the **Flag this
source for reply** button.

|Flag for reply button|

After clicking the **Flag this source for reply** button, you will see
this confirmation page. Click through to get back to the page that
displays that source's documents and replies.

|Flag for reply notification|

You will not be able to reply until after the source logs in again and
sees that you would like to talk to them. So you may have to sit and wait.
After the source sees that you'd like to reply, a GPG key pair will
automatically be generated and you can log back in and send a reply.

Moving Documents to the *Secure Viewing Station*
------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Download the encrypted submission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documents and messages sent by sources can only be decrypted and viewed on the
*Secure Viewing Station*. After clicking on an individual source, you will see
the page below with any documents or messages the source has sent you. Documents
always end with ``-doc.gz.gpg``, while messages always end with ``-msg.gpg``.

Click on a document or message name to save it, or select a number of documents
and save them all at once by clicking **Download Selected**.

|Load external content|

A dialog box with two choices will appear, **Cancel** and **Save file**:

|Download selected|

Click **Save file**. In the save dialog, select one
of the two folders highlighted in red in the screenshot below:

|Download to sandbox folder|

The difference between these two folders is as follows:

- **Tor Browser**. Downloads saved to this folder will be stored in memory,
  which means that they will only be available for the duration of your current
  Tails session. In the screenshot, this is the currently selected folder.
  The full path to this folder is ``/home/amnesia/Tor Browser``.

- **Tor Browser (persistent)**: Note that the name may be abbreviated, as shown
  in the screenshot; you can view the full name by hovering the mouse over the
  shortcut. Downloads saved to this folder will be stored
  on your Tails USB drive in the special persistent volume that is only
  available if you have unlocked it on the Tails welcome screen. The full path
  to this folder is ``/home/amnesia/Persistent/Tor Browser``.

Unless you have a reason to store encrypted submissions on the
*Journalist Workstation*, we recommend using the non-persistent "Tor Browser"
folder. In the recommended process, you will now move the submission to the
*Secure Viewing Station*, and there is no need to leave a persistent copy
behind.

.. important:: Attempting to download files to any other folder will fail.
  Tails only permits Tor Browser to access these two folders, so that
  even if your browser is compromised by malware, attackers cannot easily gain
  access to other data stored on the same computer.

  See the Tails guide to `Browsing the web with Tor Browser <https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser/index.en.html>`__
  for more information.

Step 2: Copy the encrypted submission to the *Transfer Device*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once downloaded to either folder, move the document to the designated
USB stick you intend to use to transfer the documents from your
*Journalist Workstation* to the *Secure Viewing Station*. This storage
device is known as your *Transfer Device*.

.. note::

   If the *Transfer Device* was set up according to our recommendations, you
    will be prompted for a decryption passphrase on the *Journalist
    Workstation* and the *Secure Viewing Station* before being able to use it
    in a given session. We recommend storing this passphrase in your own
    personal password manager (e.g., on your smartphone), so that it is readily
    accessible to you whenever you need it.

You can right-click the file and select **Copy to**, then select the *Transfer
Device*, as shown in the screenshots below.

|Copy to transfer device 1|

|Copy to transfer device 2|

This will leave a redundant copy behind in the Tor Browser folder. If you have
downloaded the file to the non-persistent "Tor Browser" folder (as
recommended), the redundant copy will disappear when the computer is shut down
or rebooted.

"Eject" the *Transfer Device* by clicking the eject icon next to its name in
the file manager. Wait for this operation to complete (the eject icon will
disappear), then unplug the *Transfer Device*. "Ejecting" the drive in this
manner ensures that all write operations are completed before you physically
unplug it.

Step 3: Decrypt and view the submission on the *Secure Viewing Station*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, boot up the *Secure Viewing Station* using Tails and enter the
passphrase for the *Secure Viewing Station* persistent volume. Once you
have logged in, plug in the *Transfer Device*.

.. note:: The *Secure Viewing Station* and *Journalist Workstation*
          are on separate Tails USB drives.

Click on the **Home** icon on your desktop, then on the *Transfer
Device*. Copy the file into your **Persistent** folder. You can do so by
opening a new window with the **Persistent** folder and dragging the file from
one window to another. A faster method is to drag the file to the
**Persistent** shortcut, as in the screenshot below:

|Copy files to persistent|

.. important::

   Always copy submissions to the **Persistent** folder *before* decrypting
   them. Otherwise you might accidentally decrypt them on the USB stick, and
   they could be recoverable in the future.

After successfully copying them to the *Secure Viewing Station*, erase the
files from your *Transfer Device*. Ensure you're viewing the *Transfer Device* folder, then right click on the files that need removal and click "Wipe" to
securely delete the files from your device:

|Wiping documents|

To decrypt and view documents or messages, return to your **Persistent** folder.
All key actions are initiated by double-clicking:

- Double-clicking archives in ZIP or gzip format will open the "Archive Manager"
  application (called ``file-roller`` on the command line), which allows you to extract the contents.

- Double-clicking files that end in ``.gpg`` will attempt to decrypt the
  contents to the same directory. If you have configured a passphrase for your
  *Submission Key*, you will be prompted for it.

- Double-clicking decrypted messages or documents will attempt to open them in a
  default application suitable for the file type.

If the default application does not work, you can right-click on the
document and choose **Open with Other Application...** to try opening
the document with LibreOffice Writer, Document Viewer, or another application.
You might also need to right-click on a file and choose **Rename...** to rename
a document with an incorrect or missing file extension.

.. tip::

   Always extract gzip archives with the "Archive Manager" application, which is
   the default when double-clicking the archive. Other methods may not preserve
   the filename contained in the archive.

   For example, an archive called ``1-artful_elevation-doc.gz`` might contain a
   file ``secrets.docx``, but if you extract the contents by right-clicking the
   archive and selecting **Extract here**, the extracted file will be called
   ``1-artful_elevation-doc`` instead of ``secrets.docx``. This may result in
   problems when attempting to open the file due to the loss of its file
   extension.

When you double-click an archive to open it, you should see it in the "Archive Manager" application. It looks like this:

|Opened archive|

Click the **Extract** button to unpack the archive. Navigate to the folder
containing the encrypted document message or document (ends with ``.gpg``)
and double-click it to decrypt it. The decrypted file it will have the same
filename, but without ``.gpg`` at the end.

|Decrypted documents|

You can now double-click on the decrypted file to open it in its
default application.

|Opened document|

.. _working_with_documents:

Working with Documents
----------------------

This section describes how to organize submissions, handle unusual file formats,
safely research submissions, remove metadata, and mitigate risks from
submitted malware.

.. tip::

   This is only a very limited introduction. Freedom of the Press Foundation
   publishes and maintains `digital security guides for journalists <https://freedom.press/training/>`__,
   many of which relate to these topics, and offers `digital security training <https://freedom.press/training/request-training/>`__
   for news organization staff.

Organizing submissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever you download submissions using one of the **Download** buttons in the
*Journalist Interface*, they will be organized as a ZIP archive with a built-in
folder structure, which you can use as a template for organizing submissions on
the *Secure Viewing Station*.

Submissions downloaded in this manner from the *list of all sources* will
contain a structure like the following:

.. code:: sh

    all
    ├── recessive accreditation
    │   ├── 1_2019-07-07
    │   │   └── 1-recessive_accreditation-msg.gpg
    │   └── 2_2019-07-07
    │       └── 2-recessive_accreditation-msg.gpg
    └── surviving authentication
        ├── 1_2019-07-07
        │   └── 1-surviving_authentication-doc.gz.gpg
        └── 2_2019-07-07
            └── 2-surviving_authentication-msg.gpg

Submissions downloaded in this manner from the screen for an *individual source*
will contain a similar structure, but without the parent folder ``all``.

A folder like ``1_2019-07-07`` in the example above will always contain exactly
one message or document. The numbers in the folder name (1, 2, etc.) correspond
to the numbering in the *Journalist Interface*. The dates (2019-07-07 in the
example above) are the day (in year/month/day format) of the last activity
related to this source, at the time the archive was downloaded.

If you download messages or documents one at a time in the *Journalist
Interface*, they will not be contained in a ZIP file at all. Instead, you will
be dealing with individual files like ``1-surviving_authentication-doc.gz.gpg``,
without a folder structure.

Handling File Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SecureDrop accepts submissions of any file type. Tails comes with
`pre-installed applications <https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/features/index.en.html>`__
for securely working with documents, including an office suite, graphics
tools, desktop publishing tools, audio tools, and printing and scanning tools.

For more information, visit the Tails guide to `working with sensitive documents`_.

Pre-Encrypted Submissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SecureDrop sources can optionally encrypt prior to submitting to SecureDrop.
This means that once you decrypt the document as you usually do by double
clicking the document in the file manager, there will be another layer of
encryption.

Most often, the file will be encrypted to the SecureDrop key. If the file is
encrypted to your SecureDrop key, you should be able to double click the file as
usual once more in the SVS and it should decrypt.

However, it's also possible the file is encrypted to another key, potentially
your personal key. If this occurs, you will get an error message in Tails that
reads "Decryption failed. You probably do not have the decryption key".
To determine which key was used, if you are comfortable at the command line, you
can open the ``Terminal``, navigate to the file, and use:

.. code:: sh

  gpg --decrypt NAME_OF_FILE

replacing ``NAME_OF_FILE`` with the name of the file you wish to decrypt. This
command will tell you what key was used to encrypt the file. If you are not
comfortable at the command line, contact your SecureDrop admin or
Freedom of the Press Foundation for assistance.

.. warning:: **Do not** transfer source material off the *Secure Viewing Station*
             for decryption. Instead, transfer cryptographic keys *to* the SVS
             device for decryption and metadata removal.

Researching Submissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Journalists should take care to research submissions using the Tor
Browser, ideally in a new Tails session on your *Journalist Workstation* for
highly sensitive submissions.

Removing Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip:: For detailed information about removing metadata from documents, check
   out this in-depth `guide to removing metadata`_.

Tails comes with the `Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit 2`_ (MAT2) that
is used to help strip metadata from a variety of types of files,
including png, jpg, OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents, Microsoft Office
documents, pdf, tar, tar.bz2, tar.gz, zip, mp3, mp2, mp1, mpa, ogg,
and flac. We recommend using this and other tools to work with documents within
Tails for as much of your workflow as possible.

Tails 4 replaces MAT with MAT2, which is usable via the command line and via a
context menu in the **Files** application (called ``nautilus`` on the command
line).

You can use MAT2 via the **Files** application by browsing to **Places** ▸
**(Your file's location)** and right-clicking on your file. In the context
menu, select **Remove metadata**.

|mat2 context menu|

Note that this does not alter the original file--it creates a clean copy.

|mat2 cleaned|

To use MAT2 on the command line, type ``man mat2`` to see a list of available
actions you can take with MAT2. For example, you can view the metadata of a
file with ``mat2 myfile --show``.

|mat2 cli show|

You can create a "clean" version of the document with ``mat2 myfile``, again
noting that this does not erase the metadata on the original file. This is
equivalent to the "Remove metadata" context menu option.

Note that even after running MAT2, you should carefully inspect files to ensure
that all metadata has been wiped, or convert them to a simpler file format (for
example, converting a ``.xls`` file to a ``.csv``) to ensure that metadata is
not left behind in error.

When you no longer need documents, right-click them in the Files application
and choose **Wipe** to securely delete them.

|Wiping documents|

.. _malware_risks:

Risks From Malware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SecureDrop does not scan for or remove malware in submissions you receive. There
are important steps you can take to protect yourself:

1. **Keep the version of Tails on your Secure Viewing Station up-to-date.**

   Tails offers more protection against compromise than your everyday computer,
   and the air-gap prevents potential malware from "phoning home." But if the
   version of Tails is outdated, an attacker can still attempt to exfiltrate
   or destroy information.
   |br| |br|

2. **Print documents from the Secure Viewing Station instead of exporting them
   digitally, whenever possible.**

   Printing documents prevents the proliferation of malware to your everyday
   workstation, and eliminates most categories of embedded metadata. Note that
   printing a document may still preserve watermarks, printer codes,
   steganographically encoded data, or other information not visible to the
   naked eye.
   |br| |br|

3. **Consult with your administrator or your digital security staff before
   copying files digitally.**

   If you must copy a file in digital form (because of its format, the volume
   of information, or for other reasons), we recommend taking the time to
   consult with technical experts within the organization.

   .. tip::

      Converting files to simpler formats (e.g., PDF to PNG) can help reduce the
      risk of malware. Tails provides both graphical and command-line utilities
      that can be used for this purpose.

4. **Never scan QR codes embedded in documents using a network-connected
   device.**

   `QR codes can contain malicious links`_ that your device will automatically
   visit.
   In general, be careful when opening any links provided in a SecureDrop
   submission, as this can leak information to third parties. If you are unsure
   if a link is safe to click, you should consult internally, or contact
   Freedom of the Press Foundation for assistance.
   |br| |br|

5. **Don't photograph submissions using your smartphone, and be careful with all
   digital photography**.

   Many smartphones are configured to back up photographs to cloud services,
   immediately or intermittently; newer digital cameras have similar
   functionality. Not all backup settings may be visible to you.

   Any digital photograph will include certain metadata by default, which may
   reveal sensitive information about your SecureDrop usage patterns
   (potentially including GPS coordinates) to anyone who gains access
   to the file.

Fully mitigating the risks of malware received via SecureDrop is beyond the
scope of this documentation. If you have questions, you can contact us at
securedrop@freedom.press (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__)
or via the `support portal <https://support.freedom.press/>`__. Please do **NOT**
disclose details about the contents of any submission you have received.

Moving Documents to Your Everyday Workstation
---------------------------------------------

.. important::

   As noted above, SecureDrop does not scan for or remove malware. If the file
   you received contains malware targeting the operating system and applications
   running on your everyday workstation, copying it in its original form carries
   the risk of spreading malware to that computer. Make sure you understand the
   risks, and consider other methods to export the document (e.g., print).

If you must copy a file from your *Secure Viewing Station* to your everyday
workstation in digital form, our :doc:`recommendation <set_up_transfer_and_export_device>`
is that journalists are provided with an *Export Device*, typically a USB drive,
which is encrypted using `VeraCrypt <https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html>`__.
These instructions assume that you are following the recommended workflow.
If you are unsure, ask your administrator.

.. note::

   VeraCrypt support was added to Tails in `version 3.9 <https://tails.boum.org/news/version_3.9/index.en.html>`__.
   We strongly recommend keeping your *Secure Viewing Station* up-to-date with
   each release of Tails.

To open the *Export Device* on the *Secure Viewing Station*, follow these steps:

1. If your *Export Device* has a physical write protection switch, make sure
   it is in the *unlocked* position.
2. Plug the *Export Device* into the *Secure Viewing Station*.
3. Click **Applications ▶ Utilities ▶ Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes**
4. Under "Partitions and Drives", select the *Export Device* and click
   **Unlock**.
5. Enter your passphrase, which we recommend keeping in your own personal
   password manager (e.g., on your smartphone), not on KeePassXC.
6. Under "Partitions and Drives", open the encrypted drive by clicking
   **Open**.

Steps 3-6 are illustrated below:

|Unlock VeraCrypt in Tails 1|

|Unlock VeraCrypt in Tails 2|

|Unlock VeraCrypt in Tails 3|

|Unlock VeraCrypt in Tails 4|

The *Export Device* should now open in the file manager. If there are still
files on the *Export Device* from your last copy operation,
`securely delete <https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/secure_deletion/index.en.html#index3h1>`__
them now.

Copy the file or files you want to access on your everyday workstation to the
*Export Device* using the file manager.

.. note:

Decrypting and Preparing to Publish
-----------------------------------

.. note::

   To decrypt a VeraCrypt drive on a Windows or Mac workstation, you need
   to have the VeraCrypt software installed. If you are unsure if you have the
   software installed or how to use it, ask your administrator, or see
   the `Freedom of the Press Foundation guide <https://freedom.press/training/encryption-toolkit-media-makers-veracrypt-guide/>`__
   for working with VeraCrypt.

To access the *Export Device* on your everyday workstation, follow these steps:

1. If your *Export Device* has a physical write protection switch, make sure it
   is in the *locked* position.
2. Plug the *Export Device* into your everyday workstation.
3. Launch the VeraCrypt application.
4. Click **Select Device** and select the *Export Device*, then click **OK**.
5. Click **Mount**.
6. Enter the passphrase for your *Export Device*. You should find this in your
   own personal password manager.
7. Open the *Export Device* in your operating system's file manager, and copy
   the contents of interest to your everyday workstation.

As a security precaution, we recommend deleting the files on the *Export
Device* after each copy operation. If you are using write protection, you have to perform this step on the *Secure Viewing Station* to get the security benefits of write protection.

When you are done, switch back to the VeraCrypt window, and click **Dismount**.

You are now ready to write articles and blog posts, edit video and
audio, and begin publishing important, high-impact work!
