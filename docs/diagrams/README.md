# Diagrams

This directory contains both complete and work-in-progress diagrams
and visual aids for SecureDrop.

When adding a diagram to this directory, please take a moment to add
an entry here:

- `SecureDrop.png`: A high-level overview of the components of and
  data flows through the SecureDrop architecture. Used in the
  [SecureDrop website FAQ][]. Up to date at the time of this writing.
  A symbolic link to the English version of the diagram
  (`SecureDrop-en.png`).
- `SecureDrop.svg`: Multi-lingual SVG source file used to generate
  `SecureDrop-*.png` files for the corresponding languages.
- `SecureDrop.vsdx`: The Microsoft Visio source file used to generate
  `SecureDrop-visio.png`. For context, see [#274][].
- `SecureDrop-0.3-DFD.png`: A WIP DFD (data flow diagram) created for
  SecureDrop 0.3. WIP.
