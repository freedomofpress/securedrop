Attacks and Countermeasures on the SecureDrop Environment
=========================================================

SecureDrop is a complex ecosystem comprised of various pieces of hardware, a
diverse codebase, multiple user roles, and varied software dependencies. As
such, an adversary can compromise any one of these components through a variety
of attacks, as detailed below. We’ve categorized attacks and countermeasures by
SecureDrop architecture area for clarity.

There are certain attacks that cannot be mitigated by any of the technical or
operational countermeasures built into SecureDrop. Attacks of a political nature
— for example, if a source, journalist, or organization is threatened with legal
action — are context-dependent, and determined by an ever-shifting climate
around press freedoms. While these attack vectors are out of the scope of this
document, they should be factored in to any organization’s threat model with
regional and political specificity.

Application Code — SecureDrop Repository/Release
------------------------------------------------

Attacks to the Application Code — SecureDrop Respository/Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  Malicious code introduced in SecureDrop repository

Countermeasures on the Application Code — SecureDrop Repository/Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  Code (git tags) and releases (packages uploaded to apt) are signed with the airgapped signing key
-  Protection is placed on master and develop branch on GitHub
-  For SecureDrop Developers, two-factor authentication is mandated on GitHub
