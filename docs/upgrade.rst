Upgrading SecureDrop
====================

Look up the version you wish to upgrade *to* below.

0.3.x
-----

| There are two upgrade paths to the SecureDrop 0.3.x version. Upgrading
  a
| running 0.2.1 version is a little different than upgrading a 0.3-pre
  version of
| SecureDrop. Upgrading a 0.2.1 version will require backing up the
  existing
| instance, performing a clean install (including re-installing Ubuntu)
  and then
| restoring the backup. Upgrading a 0.3-pre version does not require
| re-installing Ubuntu and has a helper script to perform the backup and
  restore.

| If a networked Admin tails workstation is not provisioned please
  follow this
| `guide <tails_guide.md>`__.

| Choose the correct guide below, depending on the version of SecureDrop
  you are
| currently running:

-  `Upgrade from 0.2.1 <0.2.1-upgrade-to-0.3.x.md>`__
-  `Upgrade from 0.3pre <0.3-pre-upgrade-to-0.3.x.md>`__
