# Upgrading 0.3 version

## Prerequisites

* An Admin networked Tails workstation with persistence enabled and an Admin password set during boot.

* Double click the "SecureDrop Init" icon to load the Tor authenticated hidden service values into your system's torrc file.

* A filled out prod-specific.yml file `/home/amnesia/Persistent/install_files/ansible-base/prod-specific.yml`

## From the admin Tails workstation:

Open a terminal (it is an icon on the top of the screen that looks like a little black TV)

* Change into the SecureDrop repo directory:

  `cd /home/amnesia/Persistent/securedrop`

* Stash your local changes to the inventory and prod-specific.yml

  `git stash save "site specific configs"`

* Pull the latest code

  `git pull`

* Checkout the latest tagged release

  `git checkout 0.3.3`

* Verify the github tag

  `git tag -v 0.3.3`

* Pop the site specific configs back in place

  `git stash pop`

## 0.3 upgrade steps

Run the 0.3 upgrade helper script. This script will do some basic sanity checks for your ansible inventory, prod-specific.yml and the system's torrc file are properly configured and then run the correct ansible playbooks.

* Run the upgrade helper script

  `./migration_scripts/0.3pre/upgrade.sh`

## Port change for the document interface

To make accessing the document interface easier for new users, the Document Interface port for the onion address has been changed from `8080` to `80`. This means you will need to update existing Journalists' bookmarks in their tor browser and remove the `:8080` from the end of the onion url.

## Notes about the 0.3 upgrade helper script

* The `backup` role will **not** run automatically.
  This is because unintentionally running the `backup` role can
  cause large file transfers over Tor, causing substantial problems during upgrade.
  If you wish to run a backup manually prior to running the upgrade script, use
  these commands:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install ansible
  cd /home/amnesia/Persistent/securedrop/install_files/ansible-base
  ansible-playbook -i inventory -u $SSH_USER --sudo securedrop-prod.yml --tags backup
  ```

  Don't forget to replace `$SSH_USER` in the command above
  with the admin username on the app and monitor servers. If you encounter connection
  timeouts during the backup, make sure to remove unnecessary submissions
  from the Document Interface, then run the command again. If you still have
  problems, contact us at securedrop@freedom.press.

* `Error: This script must be run as root.`

  Use the 'sudo' command and provide the administrative password you created at
  the beginning of the Tails session. i.e. `sudo ./upgrade.sh`

* `Error: This script must be run on Tails with a persistent volume.`

  In order for this to work, you must be running Tails on the admin workstation
  and have access to a persistent volume. Did you unlock your persistent
  storage at the beginning of the Tails session?

* `Error: There is no SSH key file present.`

  When you installed SecureDrop, you generated an SSH key (and probably saved
  to the default location: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) for the user 'amnesia' and copied
  it to both the App and Mon server. You should still have access to that key
  through the OpenSSH persistence in Tails. If you got this error, check if you
  lost the key or saved it to a different location. You won't be able to login
  to the servers remotely without it.

* `Error: This script must be run with SecureDrop's git repository cloned to 'securedrop' in your Persistent folder.`

  When you first installed SecureDrop, we assume that you cloned our GitHub
  repository to a specific location: `/home/amnesia/Persistent/securedrop`. If
  it's not there, you either need to move it there or start anew.

* `Error: There are no HidServAuth values in your torrc file.`

  Did you run the 'SecureDrop Init' script located in the Persistent folder?
  The init script and the additions it makes to Tor's configuration file are
  needed in order to access the App and Mon servers using SSH over Tor.

* `Error: monitor_ip or app_ip in prod-specific.yml is not an IP address.`

  The production playbook in `/install_files/ansible-base/prod-specific.yml`
  needs to be fully filled out, with the local IP address for each server
  specified.

* `Error: ssh_users is not defined in prod-specific.yml.`

  Inside the production playbook you must have ssh_users defined as the user
  which you use to log in to the App and Mon servers, which was created when
  you installed Ubuntu Server.

* `Error: the app or mon ansible_ssh_host in Ansible's inventory file is not an .onion address.`

  Our new provisioner, Ansible, must be run over Tor in order to reach the
  servers. Replace the IP addresses in `/install_files/ansible-base/inventory`
  with the .onion hostnames for the App and Mon server's Tor hidden services
  for SSH.

* `Error: can't connect to the Application or Monitor Server via SSH.`

  Something's wrong and we can't connect. You can re-run the script to try
  again.

  * Is the Vidalia connection indicator green?

  * Did you enter the .onion addresses correctly?

  * Are both servers powered on?

  * Try to SSH to the servers manually - did your client accept the server's host key?

  * Did the server accept your client's key?
