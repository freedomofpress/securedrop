# Upgrading SecureDrop

Look up the version you wish to upgrade *to* below.

## 0.3.x

There are two upgrade paths to the SecureDrop 0.3.3 version. Upgrading a
running 0.2.1 version is a little different than upgrading a 0.3-pre version of
SecureDrop. Upgrading a 0.2.1 version will require backing up the existing
instance, performing a clean install (including re-installing Ubuntu) and then
restoring the backup. Upgrading a 0.3-pre version does not require
re-installing Ubuntu and has a helper script to perform the backup and restore.

If a networked Admin tails workstation is not provisioned please follow this
[guide](tails_guide.md).

Choose the correct guide below, depending on the version of SecureDrop you are
currently running:

* [Upgrade from 0.2.1](0.2.1-upgrade-to-0.3.3.md)
* [Upgrade from 0.3pre](0.3-pre-upgrade-to-0.3.3.md)
