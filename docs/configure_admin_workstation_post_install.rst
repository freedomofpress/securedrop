Configure the Admin Workstation Post-Install
============================================

.. _auto-connect ATHS:

Auto-connect to the Authenticated Tor Hidden Services
-----------------------------------------------------

The SecureDrop installation process adds multiple layers of authentication to
protect access to the most sensitive assets in the SecureDrop system:

#. The Journalist Interface, because it provides access to submissions (although
   they are encrypted to an offline key), and some metadata about sources and
   submissions.
#. SSH on the *Application Server*
#. SSH on the *Monitor Server*

The installation process blocks direct access to each of these assets, and sets
up `Authenticated Tor Hidden Services`_ (ATHS) to provide authenticated access
instead. Authenticated Tor Hidden Services share the benefits of Tor Hidden
Services, but are only accessible to users who possess a shared secret
(``auth-cookie`` in the Tor documentation) that is generated during the hidden
service setup process.

In order to access an ATHS, you need to add one or more "auth-cookie" values
to your Tor configuration file (``torrc``) and restart Tor. Doing this manually
is annoying and error-prone, so SecureDrop includes a set of scripts in
``./tails_files`` that can set up a Tails instance to automatically
configure Tor to access a set of ATHS. In order to persist these changes across
reboots, the Tails instance must have persistence enabled (specifically, the
"dotfiles persistence").

.. note:: Starting in version 0.3.7, SecureDrop requires Tails 2.x or greater.

To install the auto-connect configuration, start by navigating to the directory
with these scripts (``~/Persistent/securedrop/``), and run the install script:

.. code:: sh

    ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Type the Administration Password that you selected when starting Tails and hit
**Enter**. This script installs a persistent script that runs every time you
connect to a network in Tails, and automatically configures access to
the Journalist Interface and to the servers via SSH. The HidServAuth info is
collected from files in
``~/Persistent/securedrop/install_files/ansible-base`` and stored in
``~/Persistent/.securedrop/torrc_additions`` thereafter.

.. tip:: Copy the files ``app-journalist-aths`` and ``app-source-ths`` to
         the Transfer Device in preparation for setting up the Journalist
         Workstation. Then you can use the ``securedrop-admin`` tool to configure
         access for Journalists as well.

In addition, the script creates desktop and menu shortcuts for the Source
and Journalist Interfaces, directs Tails to install Ansible at the
beginning of every session, and sets up SSH host aliases for the servers.

The only thing you need to remember to do is enable
persistence when you boot the *Admin Workstation*. If you are
using the *Admin Workstation* and are unable to connect to any
of the authenticated hidden services, restart Tails and make
sure to enable persistence.

Set up two-factor authentication for the Admin
----------------------------------------------
The SecureDrop servers should always be accessed over SSH from the Admin
Workstation. In the event of a connectivity problem, Admins can log in
directly to the servers by attaching a keyboard and a display. In order to do
so, you will need to :doc:`configure 2FA TOTP access <servers_2fa>`.
