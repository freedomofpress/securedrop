Internationalization (i18n)
===========================

The code, templates and javascript user visible strings must all be
wrapped with `gettext`_ functions to be substituted at runtime with
the equivalent localized string. These function names are used as
markers to collect the strings to be translated and store them into
the ``securedrop/translations/messages.pot`` file. For each language
to be translated, a directory is created such as
``securedrop/translations/fr_FR`` and populated with files derived
from ``securedrop/translations/messages.pot``, for translators to work
with and for the `gettext`_ substitution at runtime.

The manage.py translate helper
------------------------------

The `pybabel`_ command line is wrapped into the ``manage.py
translate`` helper for convenience. It is designed to be used by
developers, to run tests with fixtures and during packaging.

Updating strings to be translated
---------------------------------

After modifying a string in the code, templates or javascript, the
``securedrop/translations/messages.pot`` file must be updated by
running the following command in ``/vagrant/securedrop``, in the
development virtual machine:

.. code:: sh

    ./manage.py --verbose translate --extract-update

The updated ``securedrop/translations/messages.pot`` should then be
reviewed and commited. Once merged in develop, the changes will be
visible in the `Weblate`_ web interface used by translators because it
watches the develop branch of the SecureDrop repository.

Compiling translations
----------------------

`gettext`_ needs a compiled file for each language (the ``*.mo``
files). This can be done by running the following command
in ``/vagrant/securedrop``, in the development virtual machine:

.. code:: sh

    ./manage.py --verbose translate --compile


Verifying translations
----------------------

After a translation is compiled, the web page in which it shows can be
verified visually by navigating to the corresponding state from
``http://localhost:8080`` for the source interface or
``http://localhost:8081`` for the journalist interface after running
the following:

.. code:: sh

     ./manage.py run

An easier way is to generate screenshots for each desired language
with:

.. code:: sh

     $ export PAGE_LAYOUT_LOCALES=en_US,fr_FR
     $ pytest -v --page-layout tests/pages-layout
     ...
     ...TestJournalistLayout::test_col_no_documents[en_US] PASSED
     ...TestJournalistLayout::test_col_no_documents[fr_FR] PASSED
     ...

.. note:: if unset, PAGE_LAYOUT_LOCALES defaults to en_US

The screenshots for ``fr_FR`` are available in
``securedrop/tests/pages-layout/screenshots/fr_FR`` and the name of
the file can be found in the function that created it in
``securedrop/tests/pages-layout/test_journalist.py`` or
``securedrop/tests/pages-layout/test_source.py``.

Merging translations
--------------------

`Weblate`_ merges pushes the translations done via the web interface
to the develop branch in a fork of the `SecureDrop git repository`_.
These commits must be manually cherry-picked and proposed as pull
requests for the `SecureDrop git repository`_.

.. todo:: is this intermediate step necessary, even when the need-review
   flag is set ? Ideally the need-review step blocks merging and
   we can have Weblate merge in develop directly ?
