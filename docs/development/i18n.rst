Internationalization (i18n)
===========================

SecureDrop is translated into a number of languages. We use a
web-based collaborative translation platform called `Weblate`_ to make
it easier. Under the hood, all translation is done using GNU
`gettext`_.

With `gettext`_, text to be translated is specially marked in source
code. A Python example:

.. code:: python

   if not (msg or fh):
       flash(gettext("You must enter a message or choose a file to submit."), "error")
       return redirect(url_for('main.lookup'))

In this code, the string ``You must enter a message or choose a file to
submit.`` can be automatically extracted for translation. The
``gettext`` function to which it is passed is used as a marker by
`pybabel <http://babel.pocoo.org/>`__ or similar tools to collect the
strings to be translated and store them into a `.pot`_ file at
``securedrop/translations/messages.pot``. For instance:

::

    #: source_app/main.py:111
    msgid "You must enter a message or choose a file to submit."
    msgstr ""

The `.pot`_ file serves as a template for all the language-specific
`.po`_ files, which are where Weblate stores the contributed
translations. For each language to be translated, a directory is
created, such as ``securedrop/translations/fr_FR``, and populated with
a `.po`_ file derived from the template. For instance,
``securedrop/translations/fr_FR/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`` is almost
identical to ``securedrop/translations/messages.pot`` except for the
`msgstr` fields, which will contain the French translations, e.g.:

::

    #: source_app/main.py:111
    msgid "You must enter a message or choose a file to submit."
    msgstr "Vous devez saisir un message ou sélectionner un fichier à envoyer."

There's one last type of file in the `gettext`_ system, a
machine-readable version of the `.po`_ translations called a `.mo`_
file. Applications use these to get translations at runtime. The `.po`_
files are compiled to `.mo`_ files when the SecureDrop package is
installed.

The `Weblate`_ web application is used to translate strings and relies
on `gettext`_ behind the scenes. It owns the `.pot`_ and `.po`_
files. When preparing a SecureDrop release, a pull request is created
to pull in all the translations that have been updated in Weblate.

The desktop icons installed on SecureDrop workstations are also
translated.  The icon templates are in the
``install_files/ansible-base/roles/tails-config/templates`` directory.
Their labels are collected in the ``desktop.pot`` file and translated
in the corresponding `.po`_ files in the same directory (``fr.po``,
``de.po`` etc.). All translations are merged from the ``*.j2.in``
files into the corresponding ``*.j2`` file and committed to the
SecureDrop repository. They are then installed when configuring Tails
with the ``tasks/create_desktop_shortcuts.yml`` tasks.

i18n_tool.py
------------

Most of the work in managing translations within the SecureDrop code
base is supported by ``securedrop/i18n_tool.py``. It provides
convenient wrappers around `pybabel`_ and `gettext`_ , and is used to
update strings to be translated; pull translations from Weblate; to
compile translations before running tests and while packaging
SecureDrop.

Development tasks
-----------------

Add a new language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user with weblate admin rights must visit the `Weblate translation
creation page`_ and the `Weblate desktop translation creation page`_
to add a new language.

SecureDrop only supports a subset of all the languages being worked on
in `Weblate`_: some of them are partially translated or not fully
reviewed. The list of fully supported languages is hard-coded in the
``i18n_tool.py`` file, in the ``SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`` variable. When a
new language is completely translated and reviewed, the
``i18n_tool.py`` file must be manually edited to add this new language
to the ``SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`` variable.

Update strings to be translated
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After strings are modified in the SecureDrop source code, templates or
desktop labels, the ``securedrop/translations/messages.pot`` files
must also be updated. Individual developers should not do this
whenever changing strings in the code; the translations are updated in
bulk when it's time to update the Weblate fork.

Translations can be updated with the following command:

.. code:: sh

    $ make translate

This wraps ``i18n_tool.py translate-messages`` and ``i18n_tool.py
translate-desktop``.  These commands update the `.pot`_ files for the
SecureDrop server code and the desktop icons, as well as the `.po`_
files for each language.

.. note:: The new source strings will only be visible to translators
    in `Weblate`_ after the ``develop`` branch is merged into the
    Weblate fork.

.. _merge_develop_to_weblate:

Merge develop into the Weblate fork
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Weblate`_ works on a long standing fork of the `SecureDrop git
repository`_ and is exclusively responsible for the content of the
``*.pot`` and ``*.po`` files. The content of the ``develop`` branch
must be merged into the ``i18n`` branch to make updated source strings
available to Weblate.

Translation must be suspended in `Weblate`_, and any uncommitted
changes committed and pushed, to avoid conflicts:

* Go to the `Weblate repository page for SecureDrop`_.

|Weblate commit Lock|

* Click ``Commit``.
* Click ``Push``.
* And finally, click ``Lock``.

|Weblate commit Locked|

The ``develop`` branch can now be merged into ``i18n``:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop
    $ cd securedrop
    $ git remote add i18n git@github.com:freedomofpress/securedrop-i18n.git
    $ git fetch i18n
    $ git checkout -b i18n i18n/i18n
    $ git merge origin/develop
    $ make translate

The ``translate`` Makefile target uses the ``i18n_tool.py`` command to
keep the ``*.pot`` and ``*.po`` files in sync with the SecureDrop
source code. After running ``make translate``, carefully
review the output of ``git diff``. Check ``messages.pot`` first for
updated strings, looking for formatting problems. Then review the
``messages.po`` of one existing translation, with a focus on ``fuzzy``
translations. There is no need to review other translations because
they are processed in the same way. When you are satisfied with the
result, it can be merged with:

.. code:: sh

    $ git commit -a -m 'l10n: sync with upstream origin/develop'
    $ git push i18n i18n


* Go to the `Weblate commit page for SecureDrop`_ and verify the
  commit hash matches the last commit of the ``i18n`` branch. This must
  happen instantly after the branch is pushed because Weblate is
  notified via a webhook. If it is different,
  `ask for help <https://gitter.im/freedomofpress/securedrop>`__.

* Click ``Unlock``.

|Weblate commit Unlock|

`Weblate`_ pushes the translations done via the web interface
to the develop branch in a fork of the `SecureDrop git repository`_.
These commits must be manually cherry-picked and proposed as pull
requests for the `SecureDrop git repository`_.

|Weblate commit Unlocked|


.. _merge_weblate_to_develop:

Merge translations back to develop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Weblate`_ automatically pushes the translations done via the web
interface as a series of commits to the ``i18n`` branch in the
`Weblate SecureDrop branch`_, which is a fork of the ``develop``
branch of the `SecureDrop git repository`_. These translations need to
be submitted back to the ``develop`` branch via pull requests. When
you create a branch for this, begin its name with ``i18n-``, as that
prefix triggers special CI tests for translations.

To fetch the latest translations from the ``i18n`` branch into your
working copy of the SecureDrop repository, run these commands in your
repo root:

.. code:: sh

    $ git checkout -b i18n-merge origin/develop
    $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose update-from-weblate
    $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose update-docs

You now have the latest translations on your ``i18n-merge`` branch.

.. note::

    It is **very** important to check that each translated string
    looks like a plausible translation, with no markup. Even if the
    reviewer does not understand the language, if a translated string
    looks strange, someone other than the reviewer must be consulted
    to verify it means something. It is extremely unlikely that a
    contributor will manipulate a translated string to introduce a
    vulnerability in SecureDrop, but any suspicious translation should
    be investigated.

To check the new translations, you'll need to compile them and verify
them by running our automated tests and, ideally, by checking them in
the SecureDrop source and journalist interfaces.

Compile translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At runtime, `gettext`_ needs a compiled file for each language (the
`.mo`_ files). Before you can check the translations in the SecureDrop
web interfaces, these need to be created:

.. code:: sh

    $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose translate-messages --compile

For the desktop icons of the source and journalist interfaces,
compilation updates their template files with all the translations
collected from the `.po`_ files.

This can be done by running the following command:

.. code:: sh

    $ securedrop/bin/dev-shell ./i18n_tool.py --verbose translate-desktop --compile

Verify translations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SecureDrop web interfaces
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

After a translation is compiled, the web page in which it appears can
be verified visually by starting the SecureDrop development servers
and navigating via ``http://localhost:8080`` for the source interface
or ``http://localhost:8081`` for the journalist interface. You can
start the development servers with:

.. code:: sh

     $ make dev

The translations can be checked automatically by running the
SecureDrop page layout tests:

.. code:: sh

     $ export PAGE_LAYOUT_LOCALES="en_US,fr_FR"  # may be set to any supported languages
     $ make test TESTFILES=tests/pageslayout
     [...]
     tests/pageslayout/test_journalist.py::TestJournalistLayout::test_account_edit_hotp_secret[en_US] PASSED
     tests/pageslayout/test_journalist.py::TestJournalistLayout::test_account_edit_hotp_secret[fr_FR] PASSED
     [...]

.. note:: if unset, PAGE_LAYOUT_LOCALES defaults to en_US (US English) and ar (Arabic).

After running the tests, screenshots for each locale are available
in ``securedrop/tests/pageslayout/screenshots/<locale>``,
e.g. ``securedrop/tests/pageslayout/screenshots/fr_FR``. Screenshot
filenames can be found in the tests that created them, in
``securedrop/tests/pageslayout/test_journalist.py`` or
``securedrop/tests/pageslayout/test_source.py``.

Desktop icons
"""""""""""""

The translated templates for the desktop icons are:

- ``install_files/ansible-base/roles/tails-config/templates/desktop-journalist-icon.j2``
- ``install_files/ansible-base/roles/tails-config/templates/desktop-source-icon.j2``

Check that each of them contains a ``Name`` line for each of SecureDrop's supported locales.

Push your branch and create a pull request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you've checked the translations, you're ready to push your
``i18n-merge`` branch and create a pull request to get the
translations merged to the SecureDrop ``develop`` branch.

.. note:: If there have been multiple commits per language, as can
          happen if source strings need to be translated again after
          being changed to correct critical errors, or to incorporate
          suggestions from the source string feedback period, they
          should be combined via an interactive rebase. Reorder the
          commits to group them by language, then squash the commits
          for each language into one. The goal is to end up with one
          commit per supported language on the merge branch.

When you're happy with the state of language commits on your merge branch:

.. code:: sh

    $ git commit -m "l10n: compile desktop icons' translations" # if needed
    $ git push i18n-merge

.. note:: The CI job ``translation-tests`` will automatically run the
          above page layout tests in all supported languages on
          branches named with the prefix ``i18n-``. If you've followed
          that naming convention, the translation tests should soon be
          run on your pull request.

          If you have an abundance of time, you can run all the
          translation tests locally with:

          .. code:: sh

              $ make translation-test

And at long last, you're done. Go to
https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop and propose a pull
request.

.. note:: Unlike the SecureDrop application translations, the desktop
          icon translations are compiled and merged into the
          repository. They need to be available in their translated
          form when ``securedrop-admin tailsconfig`` is run, because
          the development environment is not available.

.. _i18n_release:

Release Management
------------------

Two weeks before the release: string freeze
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When features for a new SecureDrop release are frozen, the localization manager for the release will:

* :ref:`merge_develop_to_weblate`.
* Update the `i18n timeline`_ in the translation section of the forum.
* Post an announcement `to the translation section of the forum <https://forum.securedrop.org/c/translations>`__ (see `an example  <https://forum.securedrop.org/t/4-securedrop-strings-need-work-march-2018-string-freeze/461>`__).
* Remind all developers about the string freeze in `Gitter <https://gitter.im/freedomofpress/securedrop>`__.
* Add a `Weblate announcement`_ with the translation timeline for the release.
* Create a pull request for every source string suggestion coming from translators.

Release day
^^^^^^^^^^^

* :ref:`merge_weblate_to_develop`.
* :ref:`Update the screenshots <updating_screenshots>`.
* Remove the `Weblate announcement`_ about this release's translation timeline.
* Provide translator credits to add to the SecureDrop release announcement.
* Update the `i18n timeline`_ in the forum.

Translator credits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Correct acknowledgment of translators' contributions is important, so
``i18n_tool.py`` makes it easy to list the translators who have helped
since the last merge of Weblate translations, with ``i18n_tool.py
list-translators``. A list of everyone who has ever contributed
translations to SecureDrop can be obtained with ``i18n_tool.py
list-translators --all``. There are ``Makefile`` targets for these,
``list-translators`` and ``list-all-translators``, e.g:

.. code:: sh

    $ make list-all-translators
    ar:
      A. Nonymous
      Ahmad Gharbeia
      Ahmed Essam
      Ali Boshanab
    [...]

.. _i18n-administrator-permissions:

Weblate administration
----------------------

.. note:: The privilege escalation workflow is different for
          :ref:`code maintainers <contributor-permissions>` and
          :ref:`translation maintainers <i18n-administrator-permissions>`.

A translation admin has special permissions on `Weblate`_ and the
repositories. When someone is willing to become an admin, a thread is
started in `the translation section of the forum
<https://forum.securedrop.org/c/translations>`_. If there is consensus
after a week, the permissions of the new admin are elevated. If there
is not yet consensus, a public vote is organized among the current
admins.

The privileges of an admin who has not been active for six months or
more are revoked, but they can apply again at any time.

The community of SecureDrop translators works very closely with the
SecureDrop developers and some of them participate in both
groups. However, the translator community has a different set of rules
and permissions, and therefore independent policies from SecureDrop
itself.

Admin permissions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The full set of admin permissions can be granted at:

* https://weblate.securedrop.org/admin/weblate_auth/user/ (grant staff and superuser status)
* https://forum.securedrop.org/admin/users/list/active (click on the user and ``Grant Moderation``)
* https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-i18n (make sure that the user has commit access)

Granting reviewer privileges in Weblate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Visit https://weblate.securedrop.org/admin/weblate_auth/user/.
* Click on the user name.
* In the ``Groups`` block:
    * Select ``Localizationlab`` in the ``Available groups`` list and
      click on the right arrow to move it to the ``Chosen groups``
      list.
    * Select ``Users`` in the ``Chosen groups`` list and click on the
      left arrow to remove it.

Update the Weblate full text index
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Weblate`_'s full-text index can occasionally get out of sync. When
this happens, `Weblate`_'s search may fail to find a word that you
know exists in the source strings. You can rebuild the index with:

.. code:: sh

      $ ssh debian@weblate.securedrop.org
      $ cd /app/weblate
      $ sudo docker-compose run weblate rebuild_index --all --clean

Note that the new index may not be used right away. Some workers may
still have the old index open. If the index is holding up translators
with a release looming, the server can be rebooted.
