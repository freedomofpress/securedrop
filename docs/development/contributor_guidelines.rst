Contributing Guidelines
=======================

Signing commits
---------------

Commits should be signed, as `explained in the GitHub documentation <https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/>`_.
This helps verify commits proposed in a pull request are from the expected author.

Branching Strategy
------------------

SecureDrop uses a branching model based on `git-flow
<http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`__.  The ``master``
branch always points to the latest stable release. Use this branch if you are
interested in installing or auditing SecureDrop.  Development for the upcoming
release of SecureDrop takes place on ``develop``, which is the default
branch. If you want to contribute, you should branch from and submit pull
requests to ``develop``.

Automated Testing
-----------------

When a pull request is submitted, we have Travis CI automatically run the
SecureDrop test suites, which consist of:

  #. Unit tests of the Python SecureDrop application code.
  #. Functional tests that use Selenium to drive a web browser to verify the
     function of the application from the user's perspective.
  #. Tests of the system configuration state using testinfra.

Before a PR can be merged, these tests must all pass. If you modify the
application code, you should verify the tests pass locally before submitting
your PR. If you modify the server configuration, you should run the
testinfra tests. Please denote in the checklist when you submit the PR that
you have performed these checks locally.

Code Style
----------

We use code linters to keep a consistent code quality and style. These linters
also run in CI and will produce build failures. To avoid this, we have included
a git pre-commit hook. You can install it with the following command run at the
root of the repository:

.. code:: sh

    ln -sf ../../git/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit


.. note::
  The code linters are installed automatically on the Development VM, but for
  the pre-commit hook to work, you will need to install the linting tools
  locally on your host machine. From the root of the repo you can run the
  following:

  .. code:: sh

     pip install -r securedrop/requirements/develop-requirements.txt

Python
~~~~~~

All Python code should be `flake8 <http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/>`__
compliant. You can run ``flake8`` locally via:

  .. code:: sh

      make flake8

Shell
~~~~~

All Shell code (e.g. ``bash``, ``sh``) should be `shellcheck <https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck>`__
compliant. You can run ``shellcheck`` locally via:

  .. code:: sh

      make shellcheck

For reference, consult the `shellcheck wiki <https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki>`__
for detailed explanations of any reported violations.

HTML
~~~~

HTML should be in compliance with
`Google's HTML style guide <https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html>`__.
We use `html-linter <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/html-linter/>`__ to lint
our HTML templates in ``securedrop/source_templates`` and
``securedrop/journalist_templates``. Run the HTML linting options we use via:

  .. code:: sh

      make html-lint

YAML
~~~~

The Ansible configuration is specified in YAML files, including variables,
tasks, and playbooks. All YAML files in the project should pass the
`yamllint <https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint>`__ standards declared
in the ``.yamllint`` file at the root of the repository.
Run the checks locally via:

  .. code:: sh

      make yamllint

Git History
-----------

We currently use an explicit merge strategy to merge feature branches into
``develop``. In order to keep our git history as clean as possible, please squash
your commits to package up your changes into a clear history. If you have
many unnecessary commits that do not add information to aid in review, they
should be removed. If you are unfamiliar with how to squash commits with rebase,
check out this
`blog post <http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html>`__.

Privileges
----------

Dedicated contributors to SecureDrop will be granted extra privileges
such as the right to push new branches or to merge pull
requests. There is no formal process at the moment but the general
idea is that any contributor with the right technical and social
skills is entitled to ask. The people who have the power to grant such
privileges are commited to do so in a transparent way to avoid any
dispute.

Other Tips
----------

* To aid in review, please write
  `clear commit messages <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>`__
  and include a descriptive PR summary. We have a PR template that specifies the
  type of information you should include.

* To maximize the chance that your PR is merged, please include the minimal
  changes to implement the feature or fix the bug.

* If there is not an existing issue for the PR you are interested in submitting,
  you should submit an issue first or comment on an existing issue outlining how
  you intend to approach the problem.
