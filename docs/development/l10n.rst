Getting Started with Weblate Translations
=========================================

SecureDrop is a whistleblower submission system that media
organizations can use to securely accept documents from and
communicate with anonymous sources. For more information, you may be
interested to learn about :doc:`what makes SecureDrop unique
<../what_makes_securedrop_unique>`.

SecureDrop uses the Weblate platform. This page lists detailed
instructions for getting started with the Weblate platform as a
translator. Before starting this guide, you should know which language
you would like to translate.

Who uses SecureDrop?
--------------------

There are two kind of SecureDrop users: :doc:`Sources <../source>` and
:doc:`Journalists <../journalist>`. A source is an individual who
wants to communicate securely and anonymously with a
journalist. Sources are not expected to be have any technical
background. Journalists using SecureDrop have all received proper
training and know what a PGP public key is, they understand the basic
workflow of SecureDrop.
