Getting Started with Weblate Translations
=========================================

SecureDrop is a whistleblower submission system for media
organizations to securely accept documents from and
communicate with anonymous sources. For more information, you may be
interested to:

* watch `The Globe and Mail guide to using SecureDrop <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSW2wMWtAMM>`_
* read the `Localizationlab Ask me Anything on SecureDrop <https://www.localizationlab.org/blog/2018/4/20/4bp1j2olispup45z8o2mm5nb5snxm2>`_
* learn about :doc:`what makes SecureDrop unique <../what_makes_securedrop_unique>`.

SecureDrop uses the Weblate platform. This page lists detailed
instructions for getting started with the Weblate platform as a
translator. Before starting this guide, you should know which language
you would like to translate.

Who Uses SecureDrop?
--------------------

There are two kind of SecureDrop users: :doc:`Sources <../source>` and
:doc:`Journalists <../journalist>`. A source is an individual who
wants to communicate securely and anonymously with a
journalist. Sources are not expected to be have any technical
background. Journalists using SecureDrop have all received proper
training and know what a PGP public key is, they understand the basic
workflow of SecureDrop.

Register a Weblate Account
..........................

Go to the `Weblate registration page`_

|Weblate registration page screenshot|

Fill the form and click **Register** and check your email for a message 
with the subject **[Weblate] Your registration on Weblate** containing a
confirmation link from **admin@securedrop.org**
Confirming by clicking the first link will redirect you to the `Weblate dashboard`_:

Choose a Language
-----------------

From your `Weblate dashboard`_:

|Weblate dashboard screenshot|

Click the **Watched translations** menu and select **Suggested
translations**:

|Weblate suggested translations screenshot|

And click the **translate** button to the right on the line that shows
your native language:

|Weblate translate button screenshot|

Translate a Phrase
------------------

Each translatable string is shown in a **Source** box and you can
translate it right below in the **Translation** text area. When you
are done, click **Save** and the next untranslated string will appear.

For most strings a contextual screenshot is available on the right side showing
how it looks in the software. Click to see it in full size.

Instructions About a User Navigation
------------------------------------

Strings also come with instructions, further explaining them, 
and detailing where they are to be found in the user interface of the software, in case
you still aren't sure. When doing so, also verify that the steps needed to find it
are correct.::

  ...tap "Set up account"...

To find this, navigate to the localized interface of FreeOTP to get a firmer grasp
of what it does, and then translate the string displayed in place of **Set up
account**.

Placeholders
------------

Strings may contain placeholders, seen as content in between braces:
These pick in other names and functions of the software, and must be left
unmodified, but they can be moved around in a string. For instance::

  Edit user {user}

will be displayed to the user as::

  Edit user Jean-Claude

The French translated string should look like::

  Modifier l'utilisateur {user}

And it would be **incorrect** to translate the placeholder like so::

  Modifier l'utilisateur {utilisateur}

Reviews
-------

Translated strings are not put into SecureDrop before they are also reviewed.
This is to make sure the source or journalist will not be confused
by an incorrect translation.

Anyone can contribute translations, just like anyone can edit
Wikipedia. However the right to review translations, is only
extended to trusted translators can. You can ask for your _translator_
status to be elevated to _reviewer_ by posting a message in 
the `translation category of the SecureDrop forum`_.

A reviewer sees ``Waiting for review`` and ``Approved`` radio buttons 
next to strings, all of which are initially set to ``Waiting
for review``.

|Waiting for review screenshot|

When the translation is deemed correct, the reviewer should change it to
``Approved``.

|Approved screenshot|

When in this state, only reviewers can modify the string.
Translators can still suggest modifications if they notice something wrong,
and comment if they disagree.

Glossary
--------

A :doc:`glossary <../glossary>` is available, explaining terms specific
to SecureDrop. It is also important that key
terms are understood and precisely translated.

Adversary
.........

Your adversary is the person or organization attempting to undermine
your security goals. Adversaries can be different, depending on the
situation. For instance, you may worry about criminals spying on the
network of a cafe, or your classmates at a school. Often the adversary
is hypothetical.

This definition is an edited version copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/adversary>`__

Air gap
.......

If there are no networked means of communicating with a computer you own,
meaning a computer or a whole network is physically isolated from all other
networks, including by its very nature the Internet, is said to be air-gapped.

This definition is an edited version copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/air-gap>`__

Attack
......

In terms of computer security, an attack is a method used to
attempt compromising security, or just gaining access to its actual use.
An attacker is the person or organization carrying out an attack. An attack method, something targeting a 
weakness in the security, is sometimes called an "exploit."

This definition is an edited version copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/attack>`__

Command Line Tool (command)
...........................

The "command line" works by way of giving a computer a series of
small, self-contained orders (think of those science fiction movies
where teenage geniuses type long strings of green text onto black
screens). To use a command line tool, the user types a command into a
window called a terminal emulator, hits the return or enter key, and
then receives a textual response in the same window. Windows, Linux|GNU
and Apple desktop computers still let you run software using this
interface, as is the case on some mobile phones if you install the right app.
The command line can be used to run software pre-packaged with
your operating system, or install new ones. Some downloadable programs, especially
technical utilities, use the command line instead of a more familiar
"icons and buttons" user interface. The command line needn't be scary,
but it does require you to type in exactly the right set of letters
and numbers to get the correct result, and it's often unclear what to
do if the responses don't match your expectations.

This definition is an edited version copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/command-line-tool>`__


Cryptography
............

The art of designing secret codes or ciphers that let you exchange messages
with a recipient without others being able to understand the message.

This definition is an edited version copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/cryptography>`__

Decrypt
.......

Make a secret message or data intelligible. The idea behind encryption
is to make messages that can only be decrypted by the person or people meant to receive them.

This definition is an edited version copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/decrypt>`__

Encryption
..........

A process that takes a message and makes it unreadable except to a
person who knows how to decrypt it back into a readable form.

This definition was copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encryption>`__

Encryption Key
..............

An encryption key is a piece of information that is used to convert a
message into an unreadable form. In some cases, you need the same
encryption key to decode the message. In others, the encryption key
and decryption key are different.

This definition was copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/encryption-key>`__

Fingerprint
...........

The keys of public key cryptography are very large numbers, sometimes
a thousand or more digits long. A fingerprint is a much smaller number
or set of numbers and letters that can be used as a unique name for
that key, without having to list all of the key's digits.  So, for
instance, if you and a friend wished to make sure you both had the
same key, you could either spend a long time reading off all the
hundreds of digits in the key, or you could each calculate your key's
fingerprint and compare those instead. The fingerprints presented by
cryptographic software usually consist of around 40 letters and
numbers. If you carefully check that a fingerprint has the right
value, you should be safe against impersonation using a fake key. Some
software tools may offer more convenient alternative ways to verify a
friend's key, but some form of verification needs to happen to prevent
communications providers from easily being able to listen in.

HTTPS
.....

If you've ever seen a web address spelled out as
“http://www.example.com/”, you'll recognize the “http” bit of this
term. HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is the way a web browser on
your machine talks to a remote web server. Unfortunately, standard
http sends text insecurely across the Internet. HTTPS (the S stands
for “secure”) uses encryption to better protect the data you send to
websites, and the information they return to you, from prying eyes.

This definition was copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/https>`__

Key
...

In cryptography, a piece of data which gives you the capability to
encrypt or decrypt a message.

This definition was copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/key>`__

Keyring
.......

If you use public key cryptography, you'll need to keep track of many
keys: your secret, private key, your public key, and the public keys
of everyone you communicate with. The collection of these keys is
often referred to as your keyring.

This definition was copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/keyring>`__

Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM)
...............................

Suppose you believe you were speaking to your friend, Bahram, via
encrypted instant messager. To check it's really him, you ask him to
tell you the city where you first met. "Istanbul" comes the
reply. That's correct! Unfortunately, without you or Bahram knowing,
someone else online has been intercepting all your
communications. When you first connected to Bahram, you actually
connected to this person, and she, in turn, connected to Bahram. When
you think you are asking Bahram a question, she receives your message,
relays the question to Bahram, receives his answer back , and then
sends it to you. Even though you think you are communicating securely
with Bahram, you are, in fact, only communicating securely with the
spy, who is also communicating securely to Bahram! This is the
man-in-the-middle attack. Men-in-the-middle can spy on communications
or even insert false or misleading messages into your
communications. Security-focused internet communications software
needs to defend against the man-in-the-middle attack to be safe
against attackers who have control of any part of the Internet between
two communicators.

This definition was copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/man-middle-attack>`__

Public Key Encryption
.....................

Traditional encryption systems use the same secret, or key, to encrypt
and decrypt a message. So if I encrypted a file with the password
"bluetonicmonster", you would need both the file and the secret
"bluetonicmonster" to decode it. Public key encryption uses two keys:
one to encrypt, and another to decrypt. This has all kinds of useful
consequences. For one, it means that you can hand out the key to
encrypt messages to you, and as long as you keep the other key secret,
anyone with that key can talk to you securely. The key you hand out
widely is known as the "public key": hence the name of the
technique. Public key encryption is used to encrypt email and files by
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), OTR for instant messaging, and SSL/TLS for
web browsing.

Two-Factor Authentication
.........................

"Something you know, and something you have." Login systems that
require only a username and password risk being broken when someone
else can obtain (or guess) those pieces of information. Services that
offer two-factor authentication also require you to provide a separate
confirmation that you are who you say you are. The second factor could
be a one-off secret code, a number generated by a program running on a
mobile device, or a device that you carry and that you can use to
confirm who you are. Companies like banks, and major internet services
like Google, PayPal and Twitter now offer two-factor authentication.

This definition is an edited version copied from `the EFF glossary <https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/two-factor-authentication>`__

Weblate Glossary
----------------

For each string to be translated, Weblate shows a glossary of terms
and their translation to help unify their translations. For instance
when translating `Please wait for a new two-factor token before
logging in again`, Weblate notices the word `two-factor` is found in
the glossary and displays the translation in the `glossary` to the
right.

|Weblate glossary show page screenshot|

Before translating strings, it is recommended to add all terms in the
`SecureDrop localization glossary <#glossary>`_ by clicking on the pen
in the right corner of the glossary displayed with each translated
string and then `Add new word`:

|Weblate glossary add page screenshot|

When all the terms are in the glossary, it is recommended to take
another look at the full list of terms and verify there is no
duplicate or other mistakes.

|Weblate glossary list page screenshot|

.. tip:: The terms copied from the EFF glossary already have a
         translation in a number of languages.
