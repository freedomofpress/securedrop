and experienced open-source contributors and are committed to making it as easy
as possible to contribute. Whether you have a few minutes or many hours, there
are a variety of ways to help. We are always looking for help from:

* `programmers`_, to help us develop SecureDrop;
* `release managers`_, to create and maintain Debian GNU/Linux packages and repositories;

SecureDrop's code is written in `Python`_.

When you're ready to share your work with the SecureDrop team for review, submit
a `pull request
<https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/>`__
with the proposed changes. :doc:`Tests <testing_securedrop>` will run
automatically on GitHub.

If you would like to contribute on a regular basis, you'll want to read the
:doc:`developer documentation <setup_development>` and set up a local
development environment to preview changes, run tests locally, etc.


Technical Writers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technical writers and editors are invited to review the `documentation
<https://docs.securedrop.org/>`__ and fix any mistakes in accordance with the
:doc:`documentation guidelines <documentation_guidelines>`.

If this is your first time helping with SecureDrop documentation, consider
working on `low-hanging fruit`_ to become familiar with the process.

.. _`low-hanging fruit`: https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Adocs

If you're looking to contribute to copywriting user-facing text in the SecureDrop UI,
see `these issues <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/labels/NeedsCopywriting>`__
in `our separate User Experience repo <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/>`__.

DevOps
~~~~~~

The `SecureDrop web site <https://securedrop.org>`__ and the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/freedomofpress>`__ are controlled and maintained by `Freedom
of the Press Foundation employees <https://freedom.press/about/staff>`__.


Release Managers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All software deployed with SecureDrop is installed via Debian GNU/Linux packages
via Ansible. The `primary repository <https://apt.freedom.press/>`__ is
controlled, maintained, and signed by `Freedom of the Press Foundation employees
<https://freedom.press/about/staff>`__. The current responsibilities of the release manager
are covered in :doc:`detailed documentation <release_management>`.

If you are a `Debian developer <https://www.debian.org/devel/>`__ you can help
improve packaging and the release process:

* `Building SecureDrop application and OSSEC packages <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/tree/develop/molecule/builder-xenial>`__ and `pending bugs and tasks <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+package+label%3A%22goals%3A+packaging%22>`__
* Building `grsecurity kernels <https://github.com/freedomofpress/ansible-role-grsecurity>`__ and `pending bugs and tasks <https://github.com/freedomofpress/ansible-role-grsecurity/issues>`__


Translators
~~~~~~~~~~~

Translating SecureDrop is crucial to making it useful for
investigative journalism around the world. If you know English and
another language, we would welcome your help.

SecureDrop is translated using `Weblate
<https://weblate.securedrop.org/>`__. We provide a :doc:`detailed
guide <l10n>` for translators, and feel free to contact us in the
`translation section of the SecureDrop forum
<https://forum.securedrop.org/c/translations>`__ for help. Non-English
forum discussions are also welcome.

UX Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have interaction or visual design skills, UI copywriting skills, or
user research skills, check out `our User Experience repo <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/>`__.
It includes a wiki with notes from UX meetings, design standards, design
principles, links to past research synthesis efforts, and ongoing and past
work documented in the form of issues.

If you have front-end development skills, take a look at these issues on the
primary SecureDrop repo in GitHub:

* `All issues labeled "UX" <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AUX>`__
* `CSS/SASS <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACSS%2FSASS>`__ and `HTML <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AHTML>`__
* `All issues labeled "Journalist Experience" <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22goals%3A+journalist+experience%22>`__


Forum Moderators and Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Those running a production instance of SecureDrop are encouraged to `read the
support documentation <https://securedrop-support.readthedocs.io/>`__ to get
help from the `Freedom of the Press Foundation <https://freedom.press>`__. For
less sensitive topics such as running a demo or getting help to understand a
concept, a `public forum section <https://forum.securedrop.org/c/support>`__ is
better suited. To assist on the forum:

* Look for `the latest unanswered questions in the
  <https://forum.securedrop.org/c/support>`__ forum and answer them.
* If you find questions `elsewhere in the forum
  <https://forum.securedrop.org>`__ that have a better chance at
  getting an answer in the `support section
  <https://forum.securedrop.org/c/support>`__, suggest in Gitter
  to move topics from a category to another.
