Once you have chosen something to work on, it is enough to `send a
pull request
<https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/>`__
with the proposed change. :doc:`Tests <testing_securedrop>` will be
automatically run for you.

If you would like to contribute on a regular basis, you should read
the :doc:`developer documentation <setup_development>` to setup a
local development environment, run part of the tests locally etc.

Writers
~~~~~~~

Technical writers are invited to review `this documentation
<https://docs.securedrop.org/>`__ and fix any mistake in accordance to
the :doc:`documentation guidelines <documentation_guidelines>`.

Documentation tasks (bugs and improvements), ordered by priority:

* `High <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adocs+label%3AP-high>`__
* `Unspecified <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adocs>`__

DevOps
~~~~~~

The `SecureDrop web site <https://securedrop.org>`__ and the `GitHub
repository <https://github.com/freedomofpress>`__ are controlled and
maintained by `Freedom of the Press Foundation employees
<https://freedom.press/about/staff>`__. The resources under the
``securedrop.club`` domain name (listed below) are financed, controlled and
maintained `by a horizontal community of volunteers
<https://securedrop-club.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html>`__.

You will find a list of the pending tasks to improve the ``securedrop.club`` services in
the `contribution guide <https://securedrop-club.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html>`__.

If you're in doubt, feel free to reach out to the `DevOps section of
the forum <https://forum.securedrop.club/c/devops>`__ or directly to `a
team member
<https://securedrop-club.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html>`__.

Release managers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All software deployed with SecureDrop is installed via
Debian GNU/Linux packages via Ansible. The `primary repository
<https://apt.freedom.press/>`__ is controlled and maintained and signed
by `Freedom of the Press Foundation employees
<https://freedom.press/about/staff>`__. An `alternative repository
<https://packages.securedrop.club/>`__ is signed by a `community of
volunteers
<https://securedrop-club.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html>`__ and
must not be used for production purproses but is convenient for tests
and demonstrations.

If you are a `Debian Developer <https://www.debian.org/devel/>`__ you
can help improve packaging and the release process:

* `Building SecureDrop application and OSSEC packages <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/blob/develop/install_files/ansible-base/build-deb-pkgs.yml>`__ and `pending bugs and tasks <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+package+label%3A%22goals%3A+packaging%22>`__
* Building `grsecurity kernels <https://github.com/freedomofpress/ansible-role-grsecurity>`__ and `pending bugs and tasks <https://github.com/freedomofpress/ansible-role-grsecurity/issues>`__

Translators
~~~~~~~~~~~

If English is not your native tongue, your are kindly invited to help
translate SecureDrop `using the web interface
<https://weblate.securedrop.club/>`__. It is straightforward but we also
provide a :doc:`detailed guide <l10n>` to use as a reference for
details such as the meaning of placeholders etc. If you're in doubt,
feel free to reach out to the `translation section of the forum
<https://forum.securedrop.club/c/translations>`__ or even sub-sections
where non-English discussions are welcome to facilitate discussions.

As a developer or system administrator you can also help `maintain and
improve
<http://securedrop-club.readthedocs.io/en/latest/weblate.html>`__ the
self-hosted `weblate <https://weblate.org/>`__ infrastructure used by
the community of translators.

Last but not least, if you are a professional proofreader you may want
to reach out to `Localization Lab <http://localizationlab.org/>`__ and
become part of their team of reviewers. This is an important part of
the process to ensure quality translations and there are never enough
talents to complete this on-going task.


Moderators & Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People running a production instance of SecureDrop are encouraged to
`read the support documentation
<https://securedrop-support.readthedocs.io/>`__ to get help from the
`Freedom of the Press Foundation <https://freedom.press>`__. For less
sensitive topics such as running a demo or getting help to understand
a concept, a `public forum section
<https://forum.securedrop.club/c/support>`__ is better suited.

* Look for `the latest unanswered questions in the
  <https://forum.securedrop.club/c/support>`__ forum and answer them.
* If you find questions `elsewhere in the forum
  <https://forum.securedrop.club>`__ that have a better chance at
  getting an answer in the `support section
  <https://forum.securedrop.club/c/support>`__, ask a `a team member
  <https://securedrop-club.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html>`__ for
  permissions to move topics from a category to another.

Designers
~~~~~~~~~

If you know web design or have experience improving user experience,
the following tasks are waiting for your help:

* `improving user experience <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AUX>`__
* improving `CSS/SASS <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ACSS%2FSASS>`__ and `HTML <https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AHTML>`__
