This guide outlines the steps required to install SecureDrop 0.3. If you are looking to upgrade from version 0.2.1, please use the [migration scripts](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/tree/develop/migration_scripts/0.3) we have created.

When running commands or editing configuration files that include filenames, version numbers, admin or journalist names, make sure it all matches your setup.

## Terminology

A number of terms used in this guide, and in the [SecureDrop workflow diagram](https://freedom.press/securedrop-files/SecureDrop_complex.png), are specific to SecureDrop. The list below attempts to enumerate and define these terms.

### App Server

The *Application Server* (or *App Server* for short) runs the SecureDrop application. This server hosts both the website that sources access (*Source Interface*) and the website that journalists access (*Document Interface*). You may only connect to this server using Tor.

### Monitor Server

The *Monitor Server* keeps track of the *App Server* and sends out an email alert if something seems wrong. You may only connect to this server using Tor.

### Source Interface

The *Source Interface* is the website that sources will access when submitting documents and communicating with journalists. This site is hosted on the *App Server* and can only be accessed over Tor.

### Document Interface

The *Document Interface* is the website that journalists will access when downloading new documents and communicating with sources. This site is hosted on the *App Server* and can only be accessed over Tor.

### Journalist Workstation

The *Journalist Workstation* is a machine that is online and used together with the Tails operating system on the *online* USB stick. This machine will be used to connect to the *Document Interface*, download documents, and move them to the *Secure Viewing Station* using the *Transfer Device*.

### Admin Workstation

The *Admin Workstation* is a machine that the system administrator can use to connect to the *App Server* and the *Monitor Server* using Tor and SSH. The administrator will also need to have an Android or iOS device with the Google Authenticator app installed.

### Secure Viewing Station

The *Secure Viewing Station* (or *SVS* for short) is a machine that is kept offline and only ever used together with the Tails operating system on the *offline* USB stick. This machine will be used to generate GPG keys for all journalists with access to SecureDrop, as well as to decrypt and view submitted documents.

Since this machine will never touch the Internet or run an operating system other than Tails on a USB, it does not need a hard drive or network device. We recommend physically removing the drive and any networking cards (wireless, Bluetooth, etc.) from this machine.

### Two-Factor Authenticator

There are several places in the SecureDrop architecture where two-factor authentication is used to protect access to sensitive information or systems. These instances use the standard TOTP and/or HOTP algorithms, and so a variety of devices can be used to provide two factor authentication for devices. We recommend using one of:

* An Android or iOS device with [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) installed
* A [Yubikey](http://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/)

### Transfer Device

The *Transfer Device* is the physical media used to transfer encrypted documents from the *Journalist Workstation* to the *Secure Viewing Station*. Examples: a dedicated USB stick, CD-R, DVD-R, or SD card.

If you use a USB stick for the transfer device, we recommend using a small one (4GB or less). You will want to securely wipe the entire device at times, and this process takes longer for larger devices.

Depending on your threat model, you may wish to only use one-time use media (such as CD-R or DVD-R) for transferring files to and from the SVS. While doing so is cumbersome, it reduces the risk of malware (that could be run simply by opening a malicious submission) exfiltrating sensitive data, such as the private key used to decrypt submissions or the content of decrypted submissions.

## Before you begin

You will need the following inventory of hardware items for the installation. For specific hardware recommendations, see the [Hardware Guide](hardware.md).

### Computers

* Application Server
* Monitor Server
* Admin Workstation (any spare computer that can be connected to the firewall and can run Tails)

### USBs/DVDs/CDs

 * CD, DVD, or USB to use when [installing Ubuntu on the Application Server and the Monitor Server](/docs/ubuntu_config.md).
 * CD, DVD, or USB to use when [setting up Tails Live with persistence](/docs/tails_guide.md).
 * Brand new USB, marked *transfer*, to use as the *Transfer Device*.

Additionally, you will need a minimum of 4 USB sticks which will become Tails Live USB's with persistence. You should mark two *offline*, one *online*, and one *admin*. This is enough to set up a system with one admin and one journalist (note that the same person can perform both of these roles). To add more administrators or journalists, you will need more USB sticks.

Finally, each user, whether admin or journalist, will need a *Two-Factor Authenticator*.

Each journalist will also need a *Transfer Device* for transferring files between the *Secure Viewing Station* and their *Journalist Workstation*, and a personal GPG key. Make sure you [create GPG keys](/docs/install.md#set-up-journalist-gpg-keys) for journalists who do not already have one.

The second *offline* Tails Live USB with persistence will be used as the encrypted offline backup. This device will be a copy of the main *SVS* Tails Live USB with persistence.

### Passphrases

A SecureDrop installation will require at least two roles, an admin and a journalist, and each role will require a number of strong, unique passphrases. The Secure Viewing Station, which will be used by the journalist, also requires secure and unique passphrases. The list below is meant to be an overview of the accounts, passphrases and two-factor secrets that are required by SecureDrop.

We have created a KeePassX password database template that both the admin and the journalist can use on Tails to ensure they not only generate strong passphrases, but also store them safely. By using KeePassX to generate strong, unique passphrases, you will be able to achieve excellent security while also maintaining usability, since you will only have to personally memorize a small number of strong passphrases. More information about using the password database template on Tails is included in the [Tails Setup Guide](/docs/tails_guide.md#passphrase-database).

#### Admin

The admin will be using the *Admin Workstation* with Tails to connect to the App Server and the Monitor Server using Tor and SSH. The tasks performed by the admin will require the following set of passphrases:

 * A password for the persistent volume on the Admin Live USB.
 * A master password for the KeePassX password manager, which unlocks passphrases to:
     * The App Server and the Monitor Server (required to be the same).
     * The network firewall.
     * The SSH private key and, if set, the key's passphrase.
     * The GPG key that OSSEC will encrypt alerts to.
     * The admin's personal GPG key.
     * The credentials for the email account that OSSEC will send alerts to.
     * The Hidden Services values required to connect to the App and Monitor Server.
 
The admin will also need to have an Android or iOS device with the Google Authenticator app installed. This means the admin will also have the following two credentials:

 * The secret code for the App Server's two-factor authentication.
 * The secret code for the Monitor Server's two-factor authentication.
 
#### Journalist

The journalist will be using the *Journalist Workstation* with Tails to connect to the Document Interface. The tasks performed by the journalist will require the following set of passphrases:

 * A master password for the persistent volume on the Tails device.
 * A master password for the KeePassX password manager, which unlocks passphrases to:
     * The Hidden Service value required to connect to the Document Interface.
     * The Document Interface.
     * The journalist's personal GPG key.
     
The journalist will also need to have a two-factor authenticator, such as an Android or iOS device with Google Authenticator installed, or a YubiKey. This means the journalist will also have the following credential:

 * The secret code for the Document Interface's two-factor authentication.
 
#### Secure Viewing Station

The journalist will be using the *Secure Viewing Station* with Tails to decrypt and view submitted documents. The tasks performed by the journalist will require the following set of passphrases:

 * A master password for the persistent volume on the Tails device.

The backup that is created during the installation of SecureDrop is also encrypted with the application's GPG key. The backup is stored on the persistent volume of the Admin Live USB.
	
## Set up the Secure Viewing Station

The *Secure Viewing Station (SVS)* is a machine that is kept offline and only ever used together with the Tails operating system on the *offline* USB stick. Since this machine will never touch the Internet or run an operating system other than Tails on a USB, it does not need a hard drive or network device.

We recommend that you physically remove the hard drive and networking cards, such as wireless and bluetooth, from this machine. If you are unable to remove a card, tape over it or otherwise physically disable it. If you have questions about using an old machine for this purpose, please contact us at securedrop@freedom.press.

To set up the Secure Viewing Station, start by creating a Tails Live USB with persistence on the *offline* USB stick. Follow the instructions in the [Tails Guide](tails_guide.md). Stop after starting Tails and enabling the persistent volume - *do not* continue to connecting the machine to the Internet.

### Create a GPG key for the SecureDrop application

When a document is submitted through the *Source Interface* on the *App Server*, the document is automatically encrypted with the SecureDrop Application GPG key. If you have not previously created a GPG key for SecureDrop, you will need to create one now before you continue with the installation. 

Start by booting the Secure Viewing Station from the *offline* USB stick. When starting Tails, you should see a *Welcome to Tails*-screen with two options. Select *Yes* to enable the persistent volume and enter your password. Select *Yes* to show more options and click *Forward*. Enter an *Administration password* for use with this current Tails session and click *Login*.

After logging in, you will need to manually set the system time before you create the GPG key. To set the system time, right-click the time in the top menu bar and select *Adjust Date & Time.* Click *Unlock* in the top-right corner of the dialog window and enter your *Administration password.* Set the correct time and date for your region, click *Lock*, enter your password one more time and wait for the system time to update in the top menu bar. Once that's done, follow the steps below to create a GPG key.

* Open a terminal and run `gpg --gen-key`
* When it says, `Please select what kind of key you want`, choose `(1) RSA and RSA (default)`
* When it asks, `What keysize do you want?` type `4096`
* When it asks, `Key is valid for?` press Enter to keep the default
* When it asks, `Is this correct?` verify that you've entered everything correctly so far, and type `y`
* For `Real name` type: `SecureDrop`
* For `Email address`, leave the field blank and press Enter
* For `Comment` type `SecureDrop Application GPG Key`
* Verify that everything is correct so far, and type `o` for `(O)kay`
* It will pop up a box asking you to type a passphrase, but it's safe to click okay without typing one (since your persistent volume is encrypted, this GPG key is stored encrypted on disk)
* Wait for your GPG key to finish generating

To manage GPG keys using the Tails graphical interface, click the clipboard icon in the top right and choose "Manage Keys". You should see the key that you just generated.

![My Keys](images/install/keyring.png)

Select the key you just generated and click "File" and "Export". Save the key to the *Transfer Device* as `SecureDrop.asc`, and make sure you change the file type from "PGP keys" to "Armored PGP keys," which can be switched right above the 'export' button. This is the public key only.

![My Keys](images/install/exportkey.png)
![My Keys](images/install/exportkey2.png)

You'll need to verify the fingerprint for this new key during the `App Server` installation. Double-click on the new key you just generated and change to the `Details` tab. Write down the 40 hexadecimal digits under `Fingerprint`. (Your GPG key fingerprint will be different than what's in this photo.)

![Fingerprint](images/install/fingerprint.png)

### Import GPG keys for journalists with access to SecureDrop

While working on a story, journalists may need to transfer some of the documents or notes from the *Secure Viewing Station* to the journalist's work computer on the corporate network. To do this, the journalists need to decrypt the documents using the SecureDrop application's GPG key and re-encrypt them with their own keys. If a journalist does not already have a key, follow the steps above to create one. The journalist should store the private key somewhere safe, the public key should be stored on the *Secure Viewing Station*.

If the journalist does have a key, transfer the public key to the *Secure Viewing Station*, which is running Tails on the *offline* USB, using the *Transfer Device*. Open the file manager and double-click on the public key to import it. If the public key is not importing, rename the file to end in ".asc" and try again.

## Set up the Admin USB

Create the Admin USB, a Tails Live USB with persistence. See the [Tails Guide](tails_guide.md) for instructions.

## Set up the Network Firewall

See the [Network Firewall Guide](/docs/network_firewall.md) for instructions. When you are done, continue with the next section.

## Set up the Servers

Start by plugging the *Application Server* and the *Monitor Server* into the firewall. If you are using a setup where there is a switch on the LAN port, plug the *Application Server* into the switch and plug the *Monitor Server* into the OPT1 port.

Install Ubuntu 14.04.1 (Trusty) on both servers. For detailed information on installing and configuring Ubuntu for use with SecureDrop, see the [Ubuntu Install Guide](/docs/ubuntu_config.md). When you are done, make sure you have the following information before continuing:

* The IP address of the App Server
* The IP address of the Monitor Server
* The non-root user's name and password on each server.

Before continuing, make sure you can connect to the App and Monitor servers. You should still have the Admin Workstation connected to the firewall from the firewall set up step. Open a terminal and verify that you can SSH into both servers, authenticating with your password:

```sh
ssh <username>@<App IP address> hostname
ssh <username>@<Montior IP address> hostname
```

Once you have verified that you can connect, continue with the installation. If you cannot connect, check the firewall logs.

## Install SecureDrop

Connect the Admin Workstation to the LAN interface switch. Boot the Admin Workstation with the Admin Tails USB that we created earlier. Make sure to type the password in for your persistence drive, but before clicking enter, also click 'yes' for more options. Click 'forward.' You will be prompted to enter a root password. This is a one-time session password, so you will only be creating it for this one session. Continue to boot Tails.

Once Tails is booted, open a terminal (click the terminal icon in the top menu).

### Install Ansible

First, you need to update your package manager's package lists to be sure you get the latest version of Ansible. It should take a couple minutes.

    sudo apt-get update

Now, install Ansible by entering this command:

    sudo apt-get install ansible

### Clone and verify the release code

Next, you will need to clone the SecureDrop repository:

    git clone https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop.git

Before proceeding, verify the signed git tag for this release.

First, download the *Freedom of the Press Foundation Master Signing Key* and verify the fingerprint.

    gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key B89A29DB2128160B8E4B1B4CBADDE0C7FC9F6818
    gpg --fingerprint B89A29DB2128160B8E4B1B4CBADDE0C7FC9F6818

The Freedom of the Press Foundation Master Signing Key should have a fingerprint of "B89A 29DB 2128 160B 8E4B  1B4C BADD E0C7 FC9F 6818". If the fingerprint does not match, fingerprint verification has failed and you *should not* proceed with the installation. If this happens, please contact us at securedrop@freedom.press.

Verify that the current release tag was signed with the master signing key.

    cd securedrop/
    git checkout 0.3
    git tag -v 0.3

You should see 'Good signature from "Freedom of the Press Foundation Master Signing Key"' in the output of `git tag`. If you do not, signature verification has failed and you *should not* proceed with the installation. If this happens, please contact us at securedrop@freedom.press.

### Set up SSH keys for the Admin

Now that you've verified the code that's needed for installation, you need to create an SSH key on the Admin Workstation. Initially, Ubuntu has SSH configured to authenticate users with their password. This new key will be copied to the *Application Server* and the *Monitor Server*, and will replace the use of the password for authentication. Since the Admin Live USB was set up with [SSH Client persistence](https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/configure/index.en.html#index3h2), this key will be saved on the Admin Live USB and can be used in the future to authenticate to the servers in order to perform administrative tasks.

First, generate the new SSH keypair:

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

You'll be asked to "enter file in which to save the key." Here you can just keep the default, so type enter. Choose a strong passphrase to protect the SSH private key. 

Once the key has finished generating, you need to copy the public key to both servers. Use `ssh-copy-id` to copy the public key to each server in turn. Use the user name and password that you set up during Ubuntu installation.

    $ ssh-copy-id <username>@<App IP address>
    $ ssh-copy-id <username>@<Mon IP address>

Verify that you are able to authenticate to both servers without being prompted for a password:

```sh
ssh <username>@<App IP address> hostname
ssh <username>@<Montior IP address> hostname
```

### Gather the required information

Make sure you have the following information and files before continuing:

* The *App Server* IP address
* The *Monitor Server* IP address
* The SecureDrop application's GPG public key (from the *Transfer Device*)
* The SecureDrop application's GPG key fingerprint
* The email address that will receive alerts from OSSEC
* The GPG public key and fingerprint for the email address that will receive the alerts
* Connection information for the SMTP relay that handles OSSEC alerts. For more information, see the [OSSEC Alerts Guide](ossec_alerts.md).
* The first name a journalist who will be using SecureDrop (you can add more later)
* The username of the system administrator
* (Optional) An image to replace the SecureDrop logo on the *Source Interface* and *Document Interface*
    * Recommended size: `500px x 450px`
    * Recommended format: PNG

### Install SecureDrop

Change into the `ansible-base` directory of the SecureDrop repo that you cloned earlier:

    $ cd securedrop/install_files/ansible-base

Copy the following required files to `securedrop/install_files/ansible-base`:

* Application GPG public key file
* Admin GPG public key file (for encrypting OSSEC alerts)
* (Optional) Custom header image file

It will depend what the file location of your USB stick is, but, for an example, if you are already in the ansible-base directory, you can just run: 

    $ cp /media/[USB folder]/SecureDrop.asc .

Repeat the same step for the Admin GPG key and custom header image.

Edit the inventory file, `inventory`, and update the default IP addresses with the ones you chose for app and mon. When you're done, save the file and exit the editor.

Fill out `prod-specific.yml` with values that match your environment. At a minimum, you will need to provide the following:

 * User allowed to connect to both servers with SSH: `ssh_users`
 * IP address of the Monitor Server: `monitor_ip`
 * Hostname of the Monitor Server: `monitor_hostname`
 * Hostname of the Application Server: `app_hostname`
 * IP address of the Application Server: `app_ip`
 * The SecureDrop application's GPG public key: `securedrop_app_gpg_public_key`
 * The SecureDrop application's GPG key fingerprint: `securedrop_app_gpg_fingerprint`
 * GPG public key used when encrypting OSSEC alerts: `ossec_alert_gpg_public_key`
 * Fingerprint for key used when encrypting OSSEC alerts: `ossec_gpg_fpr`
 * The email address that will receive alerts from OSSEC: `ossec_alert_email`
 * Email settings required to send alerts from OSSEC: `smtp_relay`
 * Email settings required to send alerts from OSSEC: `smtp_relay_port`
 * Email settings required to send alerts from OSSEC: `sasl_username`
 * Email settings required to send alerts from OSSEC: `sasl_domain`
 * Email settings required to send alerts from OSSEC: `sasl_password`
 * The fingerprint of your SMTP relay (optional): `smtp_relay_fingerprint`

When you're done, save the file and exit the editor. 

Now you are ready to run the playbook! This will automatically configure the servers and install SecureDrop and all of its dependencies. `<username>` is the user you created during the Ubuntu installation, and should be the same user you copied the SSH public keys to.

    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory -u <username> -K --sudo site.yml

You will be prompted to enter the sudo password for each server.

The ansible playbook will run, installing SecureDrop and configuring and hardening the servers. This will take some time, and will return the Terminal to you when it is complete. If an error occurs while running the playbook, please submit a detailed [Github issue](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop/issues/new) or send an email to securedrop@freedom.press.

Once the installation is complete, the addresses for each Tor Hidden Service will be available in the following files in `install_files/ansible-base`:

* `app-source-ths`: This is the .onion address of the Source Interface
* `app-document-aths`: This is the `HidServAuth` configuration line for the Document Interface. You need to add this line to your torrc and restart Tor in order to connect to the hidden service address included in the line.
* `app-ssh-aths`: Same as above, for SSH access to the Application Server.
* `mon-ssh-aths`: Same as above, for SSH access to the Monitor Server.

Update the inventory, replacing the IP addresses with the corresponding onion addresses from `app-ssh-aths` and `mon-ssh-aths`. This will allow you to re-run the Ansible playbooks in the future, even though part of SecureDrop's hardening restricts SSH to only being over the specific authenticated Tor Hidden Services.

### Set up two-factor authentication for the Admin

As part of the SecureDrop installation process, you will need to set up two factor authentication on the App Server and Monitor Server using the Google Authenticator mobile app.

In order to connect to each server via SSH over Tor, first [make sure](/docs/tails_guide.md#set-up-easy-access-to-the-document-interface) you have the `app-ssh-aths` and `mon-ssh-aths` HidServAuth values in /etc/torrc (Tor's configuration file).

Connect to the App Server's hidden service address using `ssh` and run `google-authenticator`. Follow the instructions in [our Google Authenticator guide](/docs/google_authenticator.md) to set up the app on your Android or iOS device.

Now do the same thing on the Monitor Server. You'll end up with an account for each server in the Google Authenticator app that generates two-factor codes needed for logging in.

## Testing the Installation

Some of the final configuration is included in these testing steps, so *do not skip them!*

### Test the web application and connectivity

On your Admin Workstation running Tails:

1. Configure your torrc with the values in app-document-aths, app-ssh-aths, and mon-ssh-aths, and reload the Tor service.
 * The values listed after the .onion addresses allow access to the authenticated Tor hidden services for the App Server, Mon Server, and Admin/Document Interface. Only clients who have them configured using the HidServAuth directive in their Tor configuration can access these through Tor.
 * We have a setup script for Tails that helps you add the values and creates a launcher on the desktop to open the Admin/Document Interface. The launcher automatically reloads Tor.
 * See the 'Download and run the setup scripts' section of [Tails for the Admin and Journalist Workstation](/tails_files/README.md) and follow the instructions.
2. SSH to both servers over Tor
 * As an admin running Tails with the proper HidServAuth values in your `/etc/torrc` file, you should be able to SSH directly to the App Server and Monitor Server.
 * Post-install you can now SSH _only_ over Tor, so use the onion URLs from app-ssh-aths and mon-ssh-aths and the user created during the Ubuntu installation i.e. `ssh admin@m5apx3p7eazqj3fp.onion`.
3. Make sure the Source Interface is available, and that you can make a submission.
 * Do this by opening the Tor Browser and navigating to the onion URL from app-source-ths. Proceed through the codename generation (copy this down somewhere) and you can submit a message or attach any random unimportant file.
 * Usage of the Source Interface is covered by our [Source User Manual](/docs/source_user_manual.md).
4. SSH to the App Server, `sudo su`, cd to /var/www/securedrop, and run `./manage.py add_admin` to create the first admin user for yourself. Use a strong password that you can remember. This user is only relevant to the web application.
5. Test that you can access the Document Interface, and that you can log in as the admin user you just created.
 * Open the Tor Browser and navigate to the onion URL from app-document-aths. Enter your password and two-factor authentication code to log in.
 * If you have problems logging in to the Admin/Document Interface, SSH to the App Server and restart the ntp daemon to synchronize the time: `sudo service ntp restart`. Also check that your smartphone's time is accurate and set to network time in its device settings.
6. Test replying to the test submission.
 * While logged in as an admin, you can send a reply to the test source submission you made earlier.
 * Usage of the Document Interface is covered by our [Journalist User Manual](/docs/journalist_user_manual.md).
7. Test that the source received the reply.
 * Within Tor Browser, navigate back to the app-source-ths URL and use your previous test source codename to log in (or reload the page if it's still open) and check that the reply you just made is present.
8. Remove the test submissions you made prior to putting SecureDrop to real use. On the main Document Interface page, select all sources and click 'Delete selected'.

Once you've tested the installation and verified that everything is working, see [How to Use SecureDrop](/docs/journalist_user_manual.md).

### Additional testing

1. On each server, check that you can execute privileged commands by running `sudo su`.
2. Run `uname -r` to verify you are booted into Grsecurity kernel. The string `grsec` should be in the output.
3. Check the AppArmor status on each server with `sudo aa-status`. On a production instance all profiles should be in enforce mode.
4. Check the current applied iptables rules with `iptables-save`. It should output approximately 50 lines.
5. You should have received an email alert from OSSEC when it first started.
