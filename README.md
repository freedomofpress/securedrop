SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media organizations can use to securely accept documents from, and communicate with anonymous sources. It was originally created by the late Aaron Swartz and is currently managed by the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press).

The SecureDrop documentation is now built and hosted by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org): https://docs.securedrop.org. If you are still trying to use links to Markdown files on our GitHub to read documentation, please update your bookmarks.

There are two *versions* of the [SecureDrop documentation](https://docs.securedrop.org): **stable** and **latest**. The **stable** documentation is the default, and corresponds to the latest stable release of SecureDrop; therefore, it is the best version of the documentation for end users (Sources, Journalists, or Administrators). The **latest** documentation is automatically built from the latest commit on the SecureDrop development branch; therefore, it is most useful for developers and contributors to the project. You can choose to view a different version of the documentation by using the version picker shown at the bottom left of the screen.
