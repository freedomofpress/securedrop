SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media organizations can use to securely accept documents from, and communicate with anonymous sources. It was originally created by the late Aaron Swartz and is currently managed by the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press).

## Documentation

SecureDrop's documentation is built and hosted by [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) at https://docs.securedrop.org. It is maintained in a standalone repository: https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-docs

By default, the documentation describes the most recent SecureDrop release. This is known as the **stable** version and is recommended for end users (Sources, Journalists, or Administrators). The **latest** documentation is automatically built from the most recent commit to the SecureDrop documentation repository. It is most useful for developers and contributors to the project. You can switch between versions of the documentation by using the toolbar in the bottom left corner of the Read the Docs screen.
