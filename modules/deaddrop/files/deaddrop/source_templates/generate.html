<div id="content" class="submit-2">
  <p>To protect your identity, we're assigning you a code name.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Your code name is:</b><br />
    <span class="code-name">$iid</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need this code name to access any responses to your submission. Please memorize it or save it in a secure place if you want to be able to get responses. (However, this code name of course will help identify you as the submitter &mdash; so don't keep it anywhere it might get discovered.)

  <form method="post" action="/lookup/" autocomplete="off">

      Once you've taken care of that: <button id="continue-button" class="button-custom" type="submit">Continue...</button>
