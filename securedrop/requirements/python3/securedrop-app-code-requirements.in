# The next release of cryptography after 3.2.1 will remove support for
# OpenSSL 1.0.2, which is what we have on Xenial. If we're not on
# Focal the next time the following requirement needs to be updated,
# we will have to consider bundling a binary wheel of cryptography in
# the securedrop-app-code package, so it includes a supported version
# of OpenSSL.
