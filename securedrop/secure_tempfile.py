    Buffering large submissions in memory as they come in requires too
    much memory for too long a period. By writing the file to disk as it
    comes in using a stream cipher, we are able to minimize memory usage
    as submissions come in, while minimizing the chances of plaintext
    recovery through forensic disk analysis. They key used to encrypt
    each secure temporary file is also ephemeral, and is only stored in
    memory only for as long as needed.
