<h1>Disable JavaScript to Protect Your Anonymity</h1>

<p>JavaScript is a widely used programming language for creating interactive web pages. Unfortunately, JavaScript is also the most common source of security vulnerabilities in browsers. In August 2013, the FBI wrote malware that used a JavaScript exploit to de-anonymize Tor users (http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/09/freedom-hosting-fbi). JavaScript exploits are also mentioned in documents describing the NSA's Egotistical Giraffe (http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/egotistical-giraffe-nsa-tor-document) program, which also has the goal of targeting and de-anonymizing Tor users.</p>

<p>We encourage SecureDrop users to disable JavaScript to protect themselves from malware that would use it to attack their browser and potentially de-anonymize them. There are other ways to get hacked, but given the use of JavaScript-based attacks recently, we believe it is prudent to disable it at this time.</p>

<p>The Tor Browser comes with an add-on called NoScript that can be used to completely disable JavaScript by default, and to only enable it for sites that you trust.</p>

<p><strong>To disable JavaScript in Tor Browser, click the NoScript icon <img src="/static/i/no16.png"/> to the left of the address bar above and choose "Forbid Scripts Globally (advised)".</strong></p>
