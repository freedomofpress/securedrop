<h2>Why is there a warning about Tor2Web?</h2>
<p>Tor2Web (http://tor2web.org) is a proxy service that lets you browse Tor Hidden Services (.onion sites) without installing Tor. It was designed to facilitate anonymous publishing.</p>
<p>Tor2Web only protects publishers, not readers. If you upload documents to us using Tor2Web, you are <strong>not anonymous</strong> and could be identified by your ISP or the Tor2Web proxy operators. Additionally, since Tor2Web sites typically use HTTPS, it is possible that your connection could be MITM'ed by a capable adversary.</p>
<p>If you want to submit information, we <strong>strongly advise you</strong> to install Tor (https://www.torproject.org/download.html.en) and use it to access our site safely and anonymously.</p>
