## Problem

What is the user, security, system, or project sustainability need this Issue was created to address? Is there evidence to cite in feedback from users, contributors, or instance owners? Is there evidence to cite in a report from a domain expert, in ux or dev best practices, or in user research findings? Or, is this something you simply feel compelled to address?

## Beneficiaries

Who will directly benefit from the implementation of a solution? Users (Sources, Journalists, Admins, or Installers?), Instance owners, project contributors (FPF or volunteers), the projectâ€™s steward (FPF), or another group? Ref [SecureDrop Users](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-ux/wiki#SecureDrop_Users) if needed.

## Solution

If a solution has been devised, what is it? UX issue cross-link? Will end users experience anything new? Have UX, Security, or other domain-specific solutions been drafted? If a solution does not yet exist, what domain expertise should contribute to shaping it? Should  specific contributors be cc'd to call their attention to this?

## User Stories
If relevant.

## Acceptance Criteria
If known.
