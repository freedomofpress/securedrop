# Hard-coding the default interface used in the
# staging rules for now. In VirtualBox, eth0 is a
# NAT device used for SSH port forwards. In DigitalOcean,
# eth0 is the only device, so still the correct device
# to allow staging access to. TODO: virtualize firewall
# so these iface values are more flexible. Also consider
# enabling private_networking in DO.
