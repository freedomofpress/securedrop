# If requirements hashes are in the requirments file, pip will automatically
# use hash checking mode to install the dependencies (which is done in postinst
# of securedrop-app-code package).
# dpkg-buildpackage modifies the wheel archive such that the hashes of those
# built wheels change. Since the deb package itself is signed (providing
# integrity, we can defer to a later time.
