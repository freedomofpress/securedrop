  # After running `paxctl -Cpm` in VirtualBox, all four of those flags are set.
  # However, the current paxctl command only enforces p and m.
  # The x and e flags are present by default, but can be removed via
  # `paxctl -z <binary>`. TODO: We may want to update the command
  # to set -Cpmxe explicitly. Warrants further testing on hardware.
