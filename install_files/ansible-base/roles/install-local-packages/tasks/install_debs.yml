# This will look for packages in install_files/ansible-base,
# so the "build" directory is relative to playbook, which is
# why the parent dirs ("..") are necessary.

# There's a known bug in Ansible that causes installing
# .deb packages via the apt module to fail when invoked
# with `with_items`. A temporary workaround is to use
# `with_indexed_items` and reference the value, which tricks
# the `apt` module into installing each deb package separately,
# rather than joining into a single comma-separated string.
