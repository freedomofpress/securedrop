# Using a two-pass approach for installing local deb packages.
# The first pass uses `apt`, which will intelligently resolve dependencies;
# a useful attribute, particular for the initial provisioning run. On subsequent
# runs, however, the apt module will skip installation, since the version in
# the DEBIAN/control file hasn't changed.

# builds are not deterministic, so the `copy` task above will always report

# `dpkg -i` calls will reinstall, ensuring the latest local code changes are used.
