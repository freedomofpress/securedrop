  # If the OSSEC authd iptable rule exemptions are in place remove them and
  # restart OSSEC. The remove_ossec_exemptions role is ran on the app server
  # first then the monitor server. This order does matter. The app server's
  # ossec agent needs to restart to load the imported cert from authd and
  # connect to the ossec server. The monitor server's OSSEC server needs to
  # restart after the agent connects to correctly display the agent status.
