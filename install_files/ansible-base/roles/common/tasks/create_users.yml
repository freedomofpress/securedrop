# TODO: Backwards-compatibility. Previously, the SecureDrop bashrc additions
# for forcing a terminal multiplexer during interactive login sessions were
# added to ~/.bashrc for each admin user account. It's cleaner to add the
# config lines to /etc/profile.d, so all accounts get them by default.
# Post 0.4, we can remove this task, which is here to clean up the local
# bashrc files so that the additions are only sourced once.
