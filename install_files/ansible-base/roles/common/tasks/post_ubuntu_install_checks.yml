      Host not found. Check the pfSense logs and see if UDP traffic to the
      gateway on port 53 is blocked. You may need to add the following lines
      to `/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/tail` on each server:

      nameserver 8.8.8.8
      nameserver 8.8.4.4

      Then run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf`. This will update
      `/etc/resolv.conf` to include the new name servers. Then you can return
      to the Admin Workstation and rerun the install.
