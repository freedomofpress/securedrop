# Meta handler to bounce tor service sanely. If the SSH connection
# for the remote host is over Tor (i.e. host ends in `.onion`), then
# bounce the tor service via fire-and-forget, wait, then reestablish
# the connection after polling for the service to come back up.

# Registering a concise variable for use in conditionals, essentially
# deciding "Are we connected via SSH over Tor or not?"
