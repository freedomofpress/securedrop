# The `aa-status` command does not support machine-readable output,
# so we must parse it with sed. This is a read-only task that will
# display only the profiles listed in "complain" mode. The results
# of this check are used to conditionally set the profiles to complain
# mode only if necessary, to ensure idempotence.

# Unfortunately the `aa-complain` command does not yield useful output
# sufficient for determining changed state, but rather announces
# "Setting <profile> to complain mode" every time, which is inane.

  # You're probably thinking that no one deserves to read a sed regex like this.
  # You're probably correct. Here's a blow-by-blow, to ease the pain:
  #
  #   1. Call `aa-status` and pipe to sed (thus the use of `shell`)
  #   2. Suppress automatic printing of the stream while editing via "--quiet",
  #      since we'll explictly print desired lines via the `p` command.
  #   3. Declare START and STOP patterns, to restrict the scope of the matching.
  #      Sed calls these patterns "addresses"; see `info sed`.
  #   4. Declare a command group via '{}' that applies to matches bounded by
  #      the addresses previously declared. Reiterate the same patterns and use
  #      the branch command `b` with no label to stop processing the current cycle.
  #   5. Remove all leading whitespace, since `aa-status` indents profile names.
  #   6. Finally, print the line and terminate the command group.

    aa-status | sed --quiet
    '/profiles are in complain mode/,/processes have profiles defined/
    {/profiles are in complain mode/b;/processes have profiles defined/b;
