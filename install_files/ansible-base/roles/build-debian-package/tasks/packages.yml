# Seems superfluous, but since this role is designed to be extended,
# and therefore possibly used several times in succession, all with the
# apparent role name of "build-debian-package", it makes since to display
# the exact package name. Will also show the default "dummy-package" name
# if the default vars haven't been overridden.
- name: Declare name of package.
