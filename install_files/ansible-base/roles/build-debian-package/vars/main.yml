# The Debian control file fields should be validated prior to building.
# This role assumes that binary Debian packages are being built,
# which have slightly different (and more lax) requirements for fields.
# See docs at https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html
#
# Mandatory fields:
#
#   * Package
#   * Version
#   * Architecture
#   * Maintainer
#   * Description

# Recommended fields:
#
#   * Section
#   * Priority

# Wrapper dicts used for validating control fields for package.
