  # Do NOT!!! reload the production iptables rules during the first
  # installation. They will break the ssh connection and because of
  # that it will break the installation leaving you with no remote
  # access to the server. If this happens will need console access
  # to recover access.
  #
  # The staging exemptions will reload the iptables rules after the exemptions
  # are put in place
  #
  # For production systems the iptables rules will not be loaded until the
  # server is rebooted. This also means that any updates to the firewall in the
  # future will require a restart.
  #
  # The process should be re-desinged so the iptables rules are not applied in
  # bulk. When that is done this issue will be avoided.
