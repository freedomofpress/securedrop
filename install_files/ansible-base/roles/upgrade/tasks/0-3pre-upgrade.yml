  # This will update the App servers torrc config file for changing the
  # document interface tor port from 8080 to 80. As of this release the prod
  # playbook restarts tor if the torrc config changes. This will break ansible
  # playbook runs that are over tor. Issue #940 will track modifying the prod
  # playbook to ensure that this isn't an issue going forward.

  # This does not change the ATHS onion address or secret value only the port
  # for the interface will change.

  # This will only replace/add the line when the old HiddenServicePort config
  # for port 8080 exists. This will not modify the torrc on the monitor server
  # which only has a HiddenServicePort 22 config.
