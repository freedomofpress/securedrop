# Playbook to update SecureDrop VMs configured with the latest stable release
# to use the release candiate packages from apt-test.freedom.press (rather
# than apt.freedom.press). Updates the apt repo pubkey with a testing pubkey,
# and alters the apt source lists to point to the test server.
#
# Steps to use this playbook from an Admin Workstation:
#
#   1. Check out the current production release tag.
#   2. Provision a SecureDrop instance (hardware or VMs).
#   4. Run `./securedrop-admin tailsconfig`
#   5. Run `source admin/.venv3/bin/activate` (so ansible commands work)
#   6. Run `cd install_files/ansible-base`
#   7. Run `ansible-playbook -vv --diff securedrop-qa.yml`
#   8. `ssh app` # start interactive session
#   9. On the Application Server, run `sudo unattended-upgrades -d`
#   10. Reboot the server once the upgrade is complete
#   11. Repeat steps 8-10 on the Monitor server
