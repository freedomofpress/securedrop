# Playbook to update SecureDrop VMs to install Focal packages from a local repo
#
# Steps to use this playbook:
#
#   1. On host machine, build packages with `make build-debs-focal`
#   2. On host machine, provision local apt repo with `vagrant up apt-local`
#   3. Switch to Admin Workstation
#   3. Continue with prod provisioning as far as `./securedrop-admin sdconfig`
#   5. Run `source admin/.venv3/bin/activate` (so ansible commands work)
#   6. Run `cd install_files/ansible-base`
#   7. Run `ansible-playbook -vv --diff securedrop-apt-local.yml`
#   8. Proceed with `./securedrop-admin install`
