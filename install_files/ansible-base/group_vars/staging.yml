### Use for backup restores ###
# If the `backup_zip` variable is defined ansible will copy the defined file to
# the app server and run the 0.3_collect.py script to unzip and restore those
# files.
# ex: backup_zip: "sd-backup-2015-01-15--21-03-32.zip"
# To use uncomment the following line and enter the correct decrypted zip
# filename between the quotes.
