# Override the default logic to determine remote host connection info.
# Since we're using the "delegated" driver in Molecule, there's no inventory
# file in play for the connection, only the "instance config" file.
# Molecule will try to connect to the hostname, e.g. "app-staging".
# Let's look up the IP address already written to the instance config file,
# and wait for that address when the VMs are rebooting.
